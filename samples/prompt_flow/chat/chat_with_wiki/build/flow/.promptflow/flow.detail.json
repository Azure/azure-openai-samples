              "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) is a large language model by OpenAI and the second in their foundational series of GPT models. GPT-2 was pre-trained on BookCorpus,[2] a dataset of over 7,000 self-published fiction books from various genres, and trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages.[3] It was partially released in February 2019, followed by full release of the 1.5-billion-parameter model on November 5, 2019.[4][5][6][7][8]. GPT-2 was created as a \"direct scale-up\" of GPT-1[9] with a ten-fold increase in both its parameter count and the size of its training dataset.[8] It is a general-purpose learner and its ability to perform the various tasks was a consequence of its general ability to accurately predict the next item in a sequence,[3][10] which enabled it to translate texts, answer questions about a topic from a text, summarize passages from a larger text,[10] and generate text output on a level sometimes indistinguishable from that of humans,[11] however it could become repetitive or nonsensical when generating long passages.[12] It was superseded by GPT-3 and GPT-4 models, which are not open source anymore.. GPT-2 has, like its predecessor GPT-1 and its successors GPT-3 and GPT-4, a generative pre-trained transformer architecture, implementing a deep neural network, specifically a transformer model,[9] which uses attention instead of older recurrence- and convolution-based architectures.[13][14] Attention mechanisms allow the model to selectively focus on segments of input text it predicts to be the most relevant.[15][16] This model allows for greatly increased parallelization, and outperforms previous benchmarks for RNN/CNN/LSTM-based models.[9]. Since the transformer architecture enabled massive parallelization, GPT models could be trained on larger corpora than previous NLP (natural language processing) models. While the GPT-1 model demonstrated that the approach was viable, GPT-2 would further explore the emergent properties of networks trained on extremely large corpora. CommonCrawl, a large corpus produced by web crawling and previously used in training NLP systems,[17] was considered due to its large size, but was rejected after further review revealed large amounts of unintelligible content.[3][17] Instead, OpenAI developed a new corpus, known as WebText; rather than scraping content indiscriminately from the World Wide Web, WebText was generated by scraping only pages linked to by Reddit posts that had received at least three upvotes prior to December 2017. The corpus was subsequently cleaned; HTML documents were parsed into plain text, duplicate pages were eliminated, and Wikipedia pages were removed (since their presence in many other datasets could have induced overfitting).[3]. While the cost of training GPT-2 is known to have been $256 per hour,[18][19] the amount of hours it took to complete training is unknown; therefore, the overall training cost cannot be estimated accurately.[20] However, comparable large language models using transformer architectures have had their costs documented in more detail; the training processes for BERT and XLNet consumed, respectively, $6,912 and $245,000 of resources.[19].

Since the transformer architecture enabled massive parallelization, GPT models could be trained on larger corpora than previous NLP (natural language processing) models.

GPT-2 was pre-trained on BookCorpus,[2] a dataset of over 7,000 self-published fiction books from various genres, and trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages.[3] It was partially released in February 2019, followed by full release of the 1.5-billion-parameter model on November 5, 2019.[4][5][6][7][8]. GPT-2 was created as a \"direct scale-up\" of GPT-1[9] with a ten-fold increase in both its parameter count and the size of its training dataset.[8] It is a general-purpose learner and its ability to perform the various tasks was a consequence of its general ability to accurately predict the next item in a sequence,[3][10] which enabled it to translate texts, answer questions about a topic from a text, summarize passages from a larger text,[10] and generate text output on a level sometimes indistinguishable from that of humans,[11] however it could become repetitive or nonsensical when generating long passages.[12] It was superseded by GPT-3 and GPT-4 models, which are not open source anymore.. GPT-2 has, like its predecessor GPT-1 and its successors GPT-3 and GPT-4, a generative pre-trained transformer architecture, implementing a deep neural network, specifically a transformer model,[9] which uses attention instead of older recurrence- and convolution-based architectures.[13][14] Attention mechanisms allow the model to selectively focus on segments of input text it predicts to be the most relevant.[15][16] This model allows for greatly increased parallelization, and outperforms previous benchmarks for RNN/CNN/LSTM-based models.[9]. Since the transformer architecture enabled massive parallelization, GPT models could be trained on larger corpora than previous NLP (natural language processing) models. While the GPT-1 model demonstrated that the approach was viable, GPT-2 would further explore the emergent properties of networks trained on extremely large corpora. CommonCrawl, a large corpus produced by web crawling and previously used in training NLP systems,[17] was considered due to its large size, but was rejected after further review revealed large amounts of unintelligible content.[3][17] Instead, OpenAI developed a new corpus, known as WebText; rather than scraping content indiscriminately from the World Wide Web, WebText was generated by scraping only pages linked to by Reddit posts that had received at least three upvotes prior to December 2017. The corpus was subsequently cleaned; HTML documents were parsed into plain text, duplicate pages were eliminated, and Wikipedia pages were removed (since their presence in many other datasets could have induced overfitting).[3]. While the cost of training GPT-2 is known to have been $256 per hour,[18][19] the amount of hours it took to complete training is unknown; therefore, the overall training cost cannot be estimated accurately.[20] However, comparable large language models using transformer architectures have had their costs documented in more detail; the training processes for BERT and XLNet consumed, respectively, $6,912 and $245,000 of resources.[19].

            "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) is a large language model by OpenAI and the second in their foundational series of GPT models. GPT-2 was pre-trained on BookCorpus,[2] a dataset of over 7,000 self-published fiction books from various genres, and trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages.[3] It was partially released in February 2019, followed by full release of the 1.5-billion-parameter model on November 5, 2019.[4][5][6][7][8]. GPT-2 was created as a \"direct scale-up\" of GPT-1[9] with a ten-fold increase in both its parameter count and the size of its training dataset.[8] It is a general-purpose learner and its ability to perform the various tasks was a consequence of its general ability to accurately predict the next item in a sequence,[3][10] which enabled it to translate texts, answer questions about a topic from a text, summarize passages from a larger text,[10] and generate text output on a level sometimes indistinguishable from that of humans,[11] however it could become repetitive or nonsensical when generating long passages.[12] It was superseded by GPT-3 and GPT-4 models, which are not open source anymore.. GPT-2 has, like its predecessor GPT-1 and its successors GPT-3 and GPT-4, a generative pre-trained transformer architecture, implementing a deep neural network, specifically a transformer model,[9] which uses attention instead of older recurrence- and convolution-based architectures.[13][14] Attention mechanisms allow the model to selectively focus on segments of input text it predicts to be the most relevant.[15][16] This model allows for greatly increased parallelization, and outperforms previous benchmarks for RNN/CNN/LSTM-based models.[9]. Since the transformer architecture enabled massive parallelization, GPT models could be trained on larger corpora than previous NLP (natural language processing) models. While the GPT-1 model demonstrated that the approach was viable, GPT-2 would further explore the emergent properties of networks trained on extremely large corpora. CommonCrawl, a large corpus produced by web crawling and previously used in training NLP systems,[17] was considered due to its large size, but was rejected after further review revealed large amounts of unintelligible content.[3][17] Instead, OpenAI developed a new corpus, known as WebText; rather than scraping content indiscriminately from the World Wide Web, WebText was generated by scraping only pages linked to by Reddit posts that had received at least three upvotes prior to December 2017. The corpus was subsequently cleaned; HTML documents were parsed into plain text, duplicate pages were eliminated, and Wikipedia pages were removed (since their presence in many other datasets could have induced overfitting).[3]. While the cost of training GPT-2 is known to have been $256 per hour,[18][19] the amount of hours it took to complete training is unknown; therefore, the overall training cost cannot be estimated accurately.[20] However, comparable large language models using transformer architectures have had their costs documented in more detail; the training processes for BERT and XLNet consumed, respectively, $6,912 and $245,000 of resources.[19].

        "contexts": "Content: Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) is a large language model by OpenAI and the second in their foundational series of GPT models. GPT-2 was pre-trained on BookCorpus,[2] a dataset of over 7,000 self-published fiction books from various genres, and trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages.[3] It was partially released in February 2019, followed by full release of the 1.5-billion-parameter model on November 5, 2019.[4][5][6][7][8]. GPT-2 was created as a \"direct scale-up\" of GPT-1[9] with a ten-fold increase in both its parameter count and the size of its training dataset.[8] It is a general-purpose learner and its ability to perform the various tasks was a consequence of its general ability to accurately predict the next item in a sequence,[3][10] which enabled it to translate texts, answer questions about a topic from a text, summarize passages from a larger text,[10] and generate text output on a level sometimes indistinguishable from that of humans,[11] however it could become repetitive or nonsensical when generating long passages.[12] It was superseded by GPT-3 and GPT-4 models, which are not open source anymore.. GPT-2 has, like its predecessor GPT-1 and its successors GPT-3 and GPT-4, a generative pre-trained transformer architecture, implementing a deep neural network, specifically a transformer model,[9] which uses attention instead of older recurrence- and convolution-based architectures.[13][14] Attention mechanisms allow the model to selectively focus on segments of input text it predicts to be the most relevant.[15][16] This model allows for greatly increased parallelization, and outperforms previous benchmarks for RNN/CNN/LSTM-based models.[9]. Since the transformer architecture enabled massive parallelization, GPT models could be trained on larger corpora than previous NLP (natural language processing) models. While the GPT-1 model demonstrated that the approach was viable, GPT-2 would further explore the emergent properties of networks trained on extremely large corpora. CommonCrawl, a large corpus produced by web crawling and previously used in training NLP systems,[17] was considered due to its large size, but was rejected after further review revealed large amounts of unintelligible content.[3][17] Instead, OpenAI developed a new corpus, known as WebText; rather than scraping content indiscriminately from the World Wide Web, WebText was generated by scraping only pages linked to by Reddit posts that had received at least three upvotes prior to December 2017. The corpus was subsequently cleaned; HTML documents were parsed into plain text, duplicate pages were eliminated, and Wikipedia pages were removed (since their presence in many other datasets could have induced overfitting).[3]. While the cost of training GPT-2 is known to have been $256 per hour,[18][19] the amount of hours it took to complete training is unknown; therefore, the overall training cost cannot be estimated accurately.[20] However, comparable large language models using transformer architectures have had their costs documented in more detail; the training processes for BERT and XLNet consumed, respectively, $6,912 and $245,000 of resources.[19]. GPT-2 was first announced on 14 February 2019.\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=GPT-2\n\nContent: Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a large language model released by OpenAI in 2020. Like its predecessor, GPT-2, it is a decoder-only transformer model of deep neural network, which supersedes recurrence and convolution-based architectures with a technique known as \"attention\".[2] This attention mechanism allows the model to selectively focus on segments of input text it predicts to be most relevant.[3] It uses a 2048-tokens-long context[jargon], float16 (16-bit) precision, and a hitherto-unprecedented 175 billion parameters, requiring 350GB of storage space as each parameter takes 2 bytes of space, and has demonstrated strong \"zero-shot\" and \"few-shot\" learning abilities on many tasks.[4]. On September 22, 2020, Microsoft announced that it had licensed GPT-3 exclusively. Others can still receive output from its public API, but only Microsoft has access to the underlying model.[5]. According to The Economist, improved algorithms, more powerful computers, and a recent increase in the amount of digitized material have fueled a revolution in machine learning. New techniques in the 2010s resulted in \"rapid improvements in tasks”, including manipulating language.[6]. Software models are trained to learn by using thousands or millions of examples in a \"structure ... loosely based on the neural architecture of the brain\".[6] One architecture used in natural language processing (NLP) is a neural network based on a deep learning model that was introduced in 2017—the transformer architecture.[7] There are a number of NLP systems capable of processing, mining, organizing, connecting and contrasting textual input, as well as correctly answering questions.[8]. On June 11, 2018, OpenAI researchers and engineers published a paper introducing the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)—a type of generative large language model that is pre-trained with an enormous and diverse text corpus in datasets, followed by discriminative fine-tuning to focus on a specific task.
