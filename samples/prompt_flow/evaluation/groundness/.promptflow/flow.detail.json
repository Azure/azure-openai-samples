You need to decide whether the ANSWER is entailed by the CONTEXT by choosing one of the following rating:\n1. 5: The ANSWER follows logically from the information contained in the CONTEXT.\n2. 1: The ANSWER is logically false from the information contained in the CONTEXT.\n3. an integer score between 1 and 5 and if such integer score does not exists, use 1: It is not possible to determine whether the ANSWER is true or false without further information.\n\nRead the passage of information thoroughly and select the correct answer from the three answer labels. Read the CONTEXT thoroughly to ensure you know what the CONTEXT entails.\n\nNote the ANSWER is generated by a computer system, it can contain certain symbols, which should not be a negative factor in the evaluation.\nIndependent Examples:\n## Example Task #1 Input:\n{\"CONTEXT\": \"The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars are awards for artistic and technical merit for the film industry. They are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. The Academy Awards are regarded by many as the most prestigious, significant awards in the entertainment industry in the United States and worldwide.\", \"ANSWER\": \"Oscar is presented every other two years\"}\n## Example Task #1 Output:\n1\n## Example Task #2 Input:\n{\"CONTEXT\": \"The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars are awards for artistic and technical merit for the film industry.

Do not repeat the context.\n\n## Actual Task Input:\n{\"CONTEXT\": Track lighting, invented by Lightolier, was popular at one period of time because it was much easier to install than recessed lighting, and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall. It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts, instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer. There are traditional spots and floods, as well as other small hanging fixtures. A modified version of this is cable lighting, where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension, \"ANSWER\": The main transformer is the object that feeds all the fixtures in low voltage tracks.}\n\nActual Task Output:"
