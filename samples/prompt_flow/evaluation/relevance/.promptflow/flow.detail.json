Consider whether all and only the important aspects are contained in the answer when evaluating relevance. Given the context and question, score the relevance of the answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:\nOne star: the answer completely lacks relevance\nTwo stars: the answer mostly lacks relevance\nThree stars: the answer is partially relevant\nFour stars: the answer is mostly relevant\nFive stars: the answer has perfect relevance\n\nThis rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.\n\ncontext: Marie Curie was a Polish-born physicist and chemist who pioneered research on radioactivity and was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.\nquestion: What field did Marie Curie excel in?\nanswer: Marie Curie was a renowned painter who focused mainly on impressionist styles and techniques.\nstars: 1\n\ncontext: The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, and they are widely regarded as the most influential music band in history.\nquestion: Where were The Beatles formed?\nanswer: The band The Beatles began their journey in London, England, and they changed the history of music.\nstars: 2\n\ncontext: The recent Mars rover, Perseverance, was launched in 2020 with the main goal of searching for signs of ancient life on Mars.

It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts, instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer. There are traditional spots and floods, as well as other small hanging fixtures. A modified version of this is cable lighting, where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension\nquestion: What feeds all the fixtures in low voltage tracks instead of each light having a line-to-low voltage transformer?\nanswer: The main transformer is the object that feeds all the fixtures in low voltage tracks.\nstars:"
