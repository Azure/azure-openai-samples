      "Given the limitations of the search results, I will now summarize the information gathered from the snippets to provide an answer to the original question. Sampling in food safety refers to the collection of food products, in-process items, and raw ingredients for testing to ensure they do not contain harmful levels of contaminants or pathogens. The purpose of sampling is to prevent food safety problems before they occur and to support the development of preventive measures. The FDA uses criteria related to food-hazard pairs to identify establishments for environmental sampling. HACCP principles are also mentioned, which are a systematic approach to identifying, evaluating, and controlling food safety hazards. Sampling is a critical part of the FDA's risk-based and preventive approach to food safety, as outlined in the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act.\n",

The purpose of sampling is to prevent food safety issues by identifying potential hazards and ensuring that food products do not reach consumers with harmful levels of contaminants or pathogens. The FDA employs various types of sampling, such as environmental sampling, which uses criteria related to food-hazard pairs to identify establishments for testing.
