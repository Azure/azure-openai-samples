During a total solar eclipse, the disk of the moon completely covers the disk of the sun. There are four types of solar eclipses: total, annular, partial, and hybrid. Solar eclipses are relatively rare events, happening somewhere on earth approximately once every 18 months. They can be viewed safely with appropriate eye protection, such as solar viewing glasses, to protect your eyes from the intense sunlight."
