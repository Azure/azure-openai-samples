      "Hillary Clinton kicked off her campaign in Iowa last week and will move on to New Hampshire on Monday . article: Former president Bill Clinton said he is 'proud' of wife Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential bid for the 2016 election. The comment was said while on a visit to Oklahoma City and is the first he's made about his wife's second presidential campaign, according to CNN. The former secretary of state and first lady kicked off her campaign, which was launched last week, in Iowa and will move on to New Hampshire on Monday. Bill Clinton made the comment in Oklahoma City on Sunday where he was speaking at a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the car bombing that killed 168 people  at the Alfred P Murrah federal building in 1995 . In his first public comments on his wife's 2016 presidential bid, Bill Clinton, pictured here in 2004 with Hillary Clinton, said 'I'm proud of her' while on a visit to Oklahoma City . 'I'm proud of her,' Bill Clinton said of his wife to CNN reporter Ryan Nobles. Bill Clinton was in Oklahoma City to speak at a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the car bombing that killed 168 people including 19 toddlers at the Alfred P Murrah federal building. He addressed hundreds of people gathered at the site of the federal building to commemorate the dead, hailing the city as an example to the world of a strong and compassionate community. The service for survivors, victims' families, and other citizens began at 9.02am with a 168-second moment of silence followed by a reading of the names of those killed. 'I mostly came here to thank you today,' Clinton said. 'For a whole country you burned away all the petty squabbles in which we engaged leaving only our basic humanity. 'I prepared for this day yesterday in New York by taking Hillary to see our daughter and son-in-law and my about to be seven-month-old grandchild. 'Hillary and I bathed her and fed her and put her to bed. I looked at her in that crib so I could remember how you felt, those of you who lost your loved ones.' Visibly emotional, he wiped his eyes as he drew parallels between the 'evil' behind the Oklahoma City bombing and the terrorism of Boko Haram in North Africa, ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and lone wolf militants in cities such as Paris. 'For 20 years you have honored the memories of your loved ones, you have inspired us with the power of your renewal, you have reminded us that we should all live by the Oklahoma Standard,' Clinton said at the service. Hillary Clinton will spend Monday and Tuesday in New Hampshire, returning to the state that handed her a 2008 primary victory early in the bruising nomination struggle won by Obama. Clinton's supporters say her recent comments, particularly on inequality, do not reflect a shift in position. In her 2008 primary campaign, Clinton stressed the need to help families struggling economically and she criticized hedge fund investors, oil company profits, drug company subsidies and trade agreements. Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign last week. After spending three days in Iowa, she's off to New Hampshire for two days starting on Monday . highlights: The posters feature a portrait of Clinton with phrases including 'Don't Say Ambitious' and 'Don't Say Entitled'\n",

      "On Sunday, anti-Hillary Clinton users shared on Twitter reasons why they will not vote for her using the hashtag that began trending online . article: Anti-Hillary Clinton street art emerged in Brooklyn just hours before Clinton's presidential candidacy announcement on Sunday. The signs feature portraits of Clinton with phrases including 'Dont Say Secretive', 'Don't Say Entitled' and 'Don't Say Ambitious'. The street art appears to be a dig at a group of Clinton supporters who said it would be on the look out for evidence of sexism in reporting about the Democratic politician, according to the Weekly Standard. Last month, the New York Times' Amy Chozick brought attention to the efforts made by the group, which goes by the name of 'HRC Super Volunteers'. The descriptive terms that Clinton's fan club said it does not want applied to their candidate include 'polarizing, calculating, disingenuous, insincere, ambitious, inevitable, entitled' and 'over confident.' Scroll down for videos . Pedestrians walk past an anti-Hillary Clinton poster that says 'Don't Say Secretive' across the street from the purported Clinton campaign headquarters on Sunday in Brooklyn, New York . Another anti-Hillary Clinton poster that says 'Don't Say Entitled' is affixed to a traffic light across the street from Clinton campaign headquarters where her growing staffers began working on Friday . The posters are said to have appeared in Brooklyn on Saturday night near her campaign's new headquarters in the borough, where staffers began working on Friday. It is not known who created or posted the Brooklyn street art. Following Clinton's announcement on Sunday, a hashtag on Twitter also began trending called #WhyImNotVotingForHillary. In this image taken from video posted to hillaryclinton.com on Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton announces her campaign for president . A wave of users began using the hashtag giving their reasons for why they would not be voting for the Democratic candidate. One user wrote: '#WhyImNotVotingForHillary #benghazi plus I can't think of anything good she has done.' Another Twitter user wrote: '#WhyImNotVotingForHillary because my vote is based on candidate w integrity, forthrightness & beliefs close to mine, none of which she has.' Following Clinton's announcement on Sunday afternoon, a hasthag on Twitter began trending called #WhyImNotVotingForHillary. Above a user wrote he would not be voting for Clinton because of Benghazi . Another user wrote: 'My vote is based on candidate w integrity, forthrightness & beliefs close to mine, none of which she has' while using the anti-Hillary hashtag . Other users wrote that they are not voting for Hillary because they said 'we need more people like Reagan'. The trending hashtag appears to be started by 19-year-old Markeece Young from North Carolina who rallied users on Saturday night to make it trend on Sunday following Clinton's announcement that she was running for president. On Facebook he wrote: 'Well when I heard Hillary was announcing her campaign on Twitter I came up with the Idea to create ‪#‎WhyImNotVotingForHillary‬ it's simple but very powerful. It was the #1 trending hashtag in America for about 3 hours. On Saturday, user @YoungBLKRepub also known as Markeece Young wrote on Twitter to get the hashtag trending on Sunday when Clinton was scheduled to announce she was running for president . 'The Hillary Clinton campaign had it removed, that's right Hillary Clinton's campaign can delete the #1 hashtag in America for a cost of money. 'I'm proud that people helped me make a statement, I can say I've been causing Hillary problems since day one of her campaign. How many people can say they started the #1 hashtag in the USA and had it deleted by Hillary herself?' Clinton made her presidential campaign announcement on Sunday afternoon  leaning on a message of middle-class rescue and claims that America's economy is 'still stacked in favor of those at the top,' according to the campaign video. highlights: Laurene Jobs praised former First Lady Hillary Clinton .\n",

      "Mrs Clinton has announced her candidacy and began campaigning in Iowa .\n",
      "She described Mrs Clinton as 'America's greatest modern creation' article: Apple founder Steve Jobs' widow Laurene has told of her admiration for Democratic White House front-runner Hillary Clinton. Ms Jobs, 51, called former First Lady Hillary a 'revolutionary' woman, and added that it's not just because she's a woman - but 'the type of woman she is'. Speaking to Time 100, Ms Jobs said: 'Hillary Clinton is not familiar. She is revolutionary. Not radical, but revolutionary: The distinction is crucial. She is one of America’s greatest modern creations. Laurene Jobs, pictured, widow of Apple's Steve, has strongly backed Hillary Clinton for president . Laurene Jobs said that Hillary Clinton, right, has 'judgment and wisdom' based on her public service . 'Her decades in our public life must not blind us to the fact that she represents new realities and possibilities. Indeed, those same decades have conferred upon her what newness usually lacks: judgment, and even wisdom. 'It matters, of course, that Hillary is a woman. But what matters more is what kind of woman she is.' Mrs Clinton announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination on Sunday - and set upon the campaign trail with a trip to meet 'ordinary' voters in Iowa. But she was blasted for her 'staged' visit on Tuesday morning to a coffee shop in LeClaire, Iowa. Austin Bird, one of the men pictured sitting at the table with Mrs Clinton, claimed the whole event was orchestrated 'from beginning to end'. STAGED: Clinton sat to talk with three young Iowans at a coffee shop on Tuesday – all of whom were driven to the event by her Iowa campaign's political director . NOT SO ORDINARY: Austin Bird is a Democratic Party insider who chauffeured Vice President Joe Biden around Davenport, Iowa in October during a pre-election campaign trip . Bird told Daily Mail Online that campaign staffer Troy Price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him Tuesday morning at a restaurant in Davenport, a nearby city. Price then drove them to the coffee house to meet Clinton after vetting them for about a half-hour. The three got the lion's share of Mrs. Clinton's time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a 'roundtable'– the first of many in her brief Iowa campaign swing. Bird himself is a frequent participant in Iowa Democratic Party events. He interned with President Obama's 2012 presidential re-election campaign, and was tapped to chauffeur Vice President Joe Biden in October 2014 when he visited Davenport. 'What happened is, we were just asked to be there by Troy,' Bird said Wednesday in a phone interview. 'We were asked to come to a meeting with Troy, the three of us, at the Village Inn.' The other two, he confirmed, were University of Iowa College Democrats president Carter Bell and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland employee Sara Sedlacek. 'It was supposed to be a strategy meeting,' Bird recalled, 'to get our thoughts about issues. But then all of a sudden he says, \"Hey, we have Secretary Clinton coming in, would you like to go meet her?\"' 'And then we got in a car – Troy's car – and we went up to the coffee house, and we sat at a table and then Hillary just came up and talked with us.' Bird said 'we all were called.' 'I mean, Troy asked us all to do – to go to a meeting with him. And we didn't really know what it was about. I mean, he did. He knew.' It's unclear how many Iowans featured in photographs with Clinton that rocketed around the country on Tuesday were planted. 'The mayor of LeClaire was there, and his wife was there,' Bird said, recalling the scene at the coffee shop. Price was executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party until a month ago. Clinton's team tapped him last week to be its political director in Iowa. He did not respond to a request for comment. Bird is a government and community relations coordinator at Genesis Health System in Davenport, Iowa, according to his LinkedIn profile. A coworker at Genesis said Wednesday that Bird is 'basically a lobbyist in training. That's what he wants to do.' Bird disagreed, saying his role was 'more public relations.' He's also an outspoken progressive whose Facebook wall shows he ordered a 'Hillary For President' bumper sticker 22 months ago. 'Is it 2016 yet?' he wrote in May 2013. Clinton's nascent campaign has carefully coordinated her image as a spontaneous, handshaking populist in her first days as a candidate, posing with Pennsylvanians at a gas station and venturing into an Ohio Chipotle restaurant for lunch. When no one recognized the former first lady – she was wearing sunglasses – the campaign leaked information to The New York Times so its reporters could get security-camera footage to prove she had tried to mingle with voters. Scripting supposedly off-the-cuff appearances is common in presidential politics but could hurt Clinton especially hard since her gonzo road-trip journey to America's broad midwest is designed to counter her image as cold, calculating and politically venomous. And planting party insiders in place of typical Iowans won't go over well in the Hawkeye State, where pressing the flesh and collecting caucus votes is a quadrennial full-contact sport. ASTROTURF: Setting up faux events for news cameras is nothing new in politics, but Iowans take presidential contests seriously and could punish Clinton for the deception . THE FIXER: Bird said Troy Prince (left, pictured with VP Joe Biden), who was executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party until he left last month to help Clinton's statewide political effort, recruited him and others to attend the 'spontaneous' coffee meeting . Clinton's campaign has already taken heat for depicting at least three people in her campaign launch video as 'everyday' Americans who were actually partisans with political connections. One was even a former campaign manager for Wendy Davis, the Texas Democrat who mounted a failed bid for Texas governor last year. In LeClaire on Tuesday, Bloomberg and other outlets referred to Bird as a 'student' at St. Ambrose University, not as a hospital government-affairs staffer with Democratic party street-cred. He does study at St. Ambrose – part-time. But Bird's ties to the party are deep enough that his Facebook wall includes a photo of him standing in front of Joe Biden's limousine in Davenport. 'I was driving the Vice President when he was in town in October,' Bird noted in a Facebook comment. Biden was not there on official government business, but for a campaign stop in support of Democrat Bruce Braley. 'The Vice President will attend a grassroots event for Braley for Iowa with Representative David Loebsack,' according to White House press guidance for his October 27, 2014 schedule.\u001b[0m\n",

      "NHS England forecast a £30bn budget gap  by 2020 unless savings made . article: NHS finances are so dire that patients could soon be forced to pay to use basic services such as GPs, doctors leaders warned last night. Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges. All three major parties have denied there will be any end to the principle that the NHS should be free at the point of use. Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges . Critics will say that if GPs had not enjoyed such enormous pay rises over the past decade, there would be much more money around. In an interview with the Guardian, Dr Porter said of the parties fighting the election: ‘I think they will be tempted. They said in 1950 that a Labour government wouldn’t introduce charging and it did.’ The introduction of prescription charges prompted NHS founder Nye Bevan to resign from Clement Attlee’s government in April 1951. Dr Porter said it was ‘inescapable’ that the next government would consider introducing fees as a way of tackling the £30billion budget gap that NHS England has forecast will open by 2020 unless it achieves its target of £22billion in efficiency savings and receives £8billion of extra annual funding. He said: ‘Could a future government be tempted? Yes, they could, but they must resist that temptation.’ Critics will say that if GPs had not enjoyed such enormous pay rises over the past decade, there would be much more money around . highlights: Labour claims NHS 'cannot survive' another 5 years of Tory government .\n",

Ed Balls and the shadow health secretary Andy Burnham made the stark warning this morning, warning that the NHS 'cannot survive' another five years of the Tories in government. The Labour frontbenchers, launching a week of Labour attacks on the NHS, said there had been a 'dramatic decline in standards' in the NHS over the past five years. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said if standards continued to decline at the current rate, then by 2020 millions more will face long waits in A&E and long waits to see GPs . He said if standards continued to decline at the current rate then by 2020 millions more will face long waits in A&E and long waits to see GPs. Ambulance response times for the most serious call-outs will rise to over nine minutes, 500,000 fewer older people will receive social care and 600,000 people will be forced to wait for more than four hours on trolleys on A&E, Mr Burnham warned. Labour said the figures were based on the latest official NHS data. In the latest GP-patient Survey, 10.9 per cent of people say they were unable to get an appointment with a GP the last time they tried. This is up from 9.6 per cent in 2012. On this trend, by 2020, 14.8 per cent of people, some 8.4 million people, will be unable to get a GP appointment. A further 14.4 per cent of people are now waiting more than a week for a GP appointment. This is up from 12.0 per cent in 2012. If this trend continues, some 21.7 per cent of people – more than 12.3 million people – will wait a week or more. A further two million a year will be forced to wait over four hours in A&E – up from 1.4million last year and just 350,000 in 2009/10. Shadow  health secretary Andy Burnham said four million people will be stuck on hospital waiting lists – and a further 20 million unable to get a doctor's appointment within a week if the Tories are re-elected . Hospital waiting lists are also set to spike, Labour said. In May 2010, there were 2.57 million people on the English waiting list – but by February this year, this had grown to 3.15million. On this trend, there will be 3.8 million people on the waiting list by May 2020. Labour said more than 100,000 operations will be cancelled in 2020 – up from . Over 27,000 operations will be cancelled every year in 2020 – up from 13,000 in 2010 – with 600,000 a year waiting longer than four hours on trolleys. Nicola Sturgeon today attempted to trump Labour on the NHS with a pledge to increase its budget by more than £8billion . Ambulance call out times are also under growing pressure, Labour said. In April 2011, the average ambulance response time for immediately life-threatening call-outs was 5.30 minutes. By February 2015 response times had risen by 1.6 minutes to 6.91 minutes. If this trend were to continue over the next five years, the average ambulance response time in May 2020 would be 9.12 minutes, an increase of over two thirds on 2010. The Tories said Labour were using the NHS as a political football. A Conservative spokesperson said: 'This marks a new low in Ed Miliband's desperate attempts to weaponise the NHS. His credibility on health is in tatters because he refuses to fund the £8 billion the NHS needs. 'By building a stronger economy, we have protected and improved the NHS with 9,500 more doctors, 6,900 more nurses, and 1.3 million more life-saving operations every year. 'There is only one threat to the future of our NHS and that is the economic chaos of an Ed Miliband-SNP government.' The future of the straining health service has become one of the key battlegrounds of the General Election, with Conservatives and Liberal Democrats pledging to find the £8 billion health chiefs say is needed by 2020 to prevent it buckling. Labour has refused to commit to providing the same amount but insists it will do 'what is necessary' and says its £2.5 billion spending plans are the only fully-funded proposals put forward so far. In an election dossier on the NHS, Labour accuse the Tories of having a secret plan for NHS charging. It claims public spending under the Conservatives would drop to levels similar to countries that have greater charging in healthcare, such as Switzerland, Mexico and Chile. At the launch of Labour's week of NHS campaigning, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 'This is the real face of the Tory Party. They have let the cat out of the bag - five more years of David Cameron means more NHS privatisation and charging. 'It is clear that, just like last time, Cameron's NHS promises have an expiry date of election day stamped on them. He promised no top-down reorganisation and brought forward the biggest-ever top-down reorganisation. If he gets back in, the NHS will be sunk by a toxic mix of cuts and privatisation.' David Cameron and George Osborne, at a campaign event in Crewe this morning, have accused the Labour Party of using the NHS as a political football . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls added: 'David Cameron is a serial offender when it comes to claims at election time. He broke his promises on the NHS, on VAT and on tax credits last time. And he'll break his promises again. 'Because on top of their extreme spending plans to double the cuts next year, the Tories have made billions of pounds of unfunded commitments in this election, including £10 billion of tax cuts and billions of pounds for rail fare freezes and paid time off for public servants to volunteer. 'And these unfunded promises will come before the NHS in the queue.' In a speech to the Scottish Trades Union Congress Mr Miliband will say: 'The Tory plans on the NHS are a double deceit. 'They are not being straight about their extreme plans to double the cuts to public services next year. 'And they are not being straight when they promise to protect the NHS, but cannot say where a penny of additional money will come from. 'This double deceit is a double danger to the NHS. They have extreme spending plans and they can't tell us where the money is coming from. 'David Cameron poses a risk to the very fabric and foundation of our NHS. 'That's why we will fight every day to May 7 to stop a Tory plan that threatens our NHS. 'And it's why we have a different approach. 'A fully funded plan, with a mansion tax on properties worth over £2 million to pay for more nurses and doctors in every part of the United Kingdom.'\u001b[0m\n",

      "On Sunday, anti-Hillary Clinton users shared on Twitter reasons why they will not vote for her using the hashtag that began trending online . article: Anti-Hillary Clinton street art emerged in Brooklyn just hours before Clinton's presidential candidacy announcement on Sunday. The signs feature portraits of Clinton with phrases including 'Dont Say Secretive', 'Don't Say Entitled' and 'Don't Say Ambitious'. The street art appears to be a dig at a group of Clinton supporters who said it would be on the look out for evidence of sexism in reporting about the Democratic politician, according to the Weekly Standard. Last month, the New York Times' Amy Chozick brought attention to the efforts made by the group, which goes by the name of 'HRC Super Volunteers'. The descriptive terms that Clinton's fan club said it does not want applied to their candidate include 'polarizing, calculating, disingenuous, insincere, ambitious, inevitable, entitled' and 'over confident.' Scroll down for videos . Pedestrians walk past an anti-Hillary Clinton poster that says 'Don't Say Secretive' across the street from the purported Clinton campaign headquarters on Sunday in Brooklyn, New York . Another anti-Hillary Clinton poster that says 'Don't Say Entitled' is affixed to a traffic light across the street from Clinton campaign headquarters where her growing staffers began working on Friday . The posters are said to have appeared in Brooklyn on Saturday night near her campaign's new headquarters in the borough, where staffers began working on Friday. It is not known who created or posted the Brooklyn street art. Following Clinton's announcement on Sunday, a hashtag on Twitter also began trending called #WhyImNotVotingForHillary. In this image taken from video posted to hillaryclinton.com on Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton announces her campaign for president . A wave of users began using the hashtag giving their reasons for why they would not be voting for the Democratic candidate. One user wrote: '#WhyImNotVotingForHillary #benghazi plus I can't think of anything good she has done.' Another Twitter user wrote: '#WhyImNotVotingForHillary because my vote is based on candidate w integrity, forthrightness & beliefs close to mine, none of which she has.' Following Clinton's announcement on Sunday afternoon, a hasthag on Twitter began trending called #WhyImNotVotingForHillary. Above a user wrote he would not be voting for Clinton because of Benghazi . Another user wrote: 'My vote is based on candidate w integrity, forthrightness & beliefs close to mine, none of which she has' while using the anti-Hillary hashtag . Other users wrote that they are not voting for Hillary because they said 'we need more people like Reagan'. The trending hashtag appears to be started by 19-year-old Markeece Young from North Carolina who rallied users on Saturday night to make it trend on Sunday following Clinton's announcement that she was running for president. On Facebook he wrote: 'Well when I heard Hillary was announcing her campaign on Twitter I came up with the Idea to create ‪#‎WhyImNotVotingForHillary‬ it's simple but very powerful. It was the #1 trending hashtag in America for about 3 hours. On Saturday, user @YoungBLKRepub also known as Markeece Young wrote on Twitter to get the hashtag trending on Sunday when Clinton was scheduled to announce she was running for president . 'The Hillary Clinton campaign had it removed, that's right Hillary Clinton's campaign can delete the #1 hashtag in America for a cost of money. 'I'm proud that people helped me make a statement, I can say I've been causing Hillary problems since day one of her campaign. How many people can say they started the #1 hashtag in the USA and had it deleted by Hillary herself?' Clinton made her presidential campaign announcement on Sunday afternoon  leaning on a message of middle-class rescue and claims that America's economy is 'still stacked in favor of those at the top,' according to the campaign video. highlights: Dr Mark Porter said election winner will be tempted to bring in charges .\n",
      "NHS England forecast a £30bn budget gap  by 2020 unless savings made . article: NHS finances are so dire that patients could soon be forced to pay to use basic services such as GPs, doctors leaders warned last night. Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges. All three major parties have denied there will be any end to the principle that the NHS should be free at the point of use. Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges . Critics will say that if GPs had not enjoyed such enormous pay rises over the past decade, there would be much more money around. In an interview with the Guardian, Dr Porter said of the parties fighting the election: ‘I think they will be tempted. They said in 1950 that a Labour government wouldn’t introduce charging and it did.’ The introduction of prescription charges prompted NHS founder Nye Bevan to resign from Clement Attlee’s government in April 1951. Dr Porter said it was ‘inescapable’ that the next government would consider introducing fees as a way of tackling the £30billion budget gap that NHS England has forecast will open by 2020 unless it achieves its target of £22billion in efficiency savings and receives £8billion of extra annual funding. He said: ‘Could a future government be tempted? Yes, they could, but they must resist that temptation.’ Critics will say that if GPs had not enjoyed such enormous pay rises over the past decade, there would be much more money around . highlights: S.E. Cupp: Clinton making women central to outreach, but she should really focus on men .\n",
      "In 2014 election, overplaying to one gender failed -- particularly with \"war on women\" article: (CNN)It's clear from Hillary Clinton's campaign rollout -- a video announcement/campaign ad/short film that debuted Sunday afternoon -- that she will make women and being a woman central to her outreach. In case you're skeptical, Vox has posted a handy \"by the numbers\" for her campaign video, and there are 38 people besides Clinton in the two-minute ad. Twenty of them are women. There are three separate mentions of motherhood. This is all fine and good (and predictable) if you acknowledge that the proportion of women who vote has exceeded the proportion of men who vote in every presidential election since 1980. And let's not overlook the fact that Clinton is in fact a woman, and that's a fine thing to celebrate. But in reality, she doesn't have to wonder if a woman-centered campaign is the best strategy. She can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible-voting population failed spectacularly all over the country, in red and blue states, when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates. As I've previously written, the 2014 midterm elections saw the death of a political meme: the \"war on women.\" Granted, that's not because Republicans convinced the country that they were the party of women. But it is noteworthy that Democrats who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues (and men) crashed and burned. To wit: . In Colorado, Sen. Mark Udall was nicknamed \"Mark Uterus\" for all the time he spent fear-mongering on women's reproductive issues, only to end up, according to exit polls, eight points ahead among women. His opponent, Cory Gardner, finished 17 points ahead among men. In New York, a Democratic candidate for Congress, Martha Robertson, drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a \"war on women.\" To repeat, she was a woman, a Democrat, in New York. In Louisiana, Sen. Mary Landrieu sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for Democrats' lack of popularity in the South. Not surprisingly, Southerners voted for her opponent, Bill Cassidy. In Texas, where liberal Wendy Davis ran almost entirely on an abortion-rights platform, she accused Republicans of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography. Her opponent, Greg Abbott, won by 20 points, and Davis only ended up with 47% of the women vote. Whether in Texas or Colorado, New York or Louisiana, voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and weren't going to be bullied into voting Democratic by false cries of sexism. But while Democrats were screaming about the Republicans' \"war on women,\" few in the media acknowledged that the Democrats' deficit among men was actually greater than the Republicans' deficit among women. Exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for Republicans over Democrats by a 16-point margin, and women voted for Democrats by only a four-point margin. Regardless of whom Republicans run for president, Hillary Clinton will most likely get the women vote. What she needs are men. So instead of running a woman-centered campaign, she might want to figure out a way to court the other sex.\u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m I now know the final answer\n",
      "Final Answer: Clinton should focus on a campaign that appeals to both men and women, rather than just women, in order to have a better chance of winning the 2020 election. She should avoid overplaying to one gender, as this strategy failed in the 2014 election, particularly with the \"war on women\" meme.\u001b[0m\n",
