{"file": "2211.01910.json", "summerization_type": "map_reduce", "summary": " This paper proposes a black-box optimization problem using large language models to generate and search for heuristically viable candidate solutions for natural language program synthesis. Experiments on 24 NLP tasks show that the automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline and achieve better or comparable performance to the instructions generated by human annotators. The paper also evaluates the transfer ability of the APE instruction to a different model and finds that the APE instruction is able to transfer with high accuracy."}
