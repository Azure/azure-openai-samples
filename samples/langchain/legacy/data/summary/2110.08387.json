Experiments show that the generated knowledge statements can improve the accuracy of the model, and that the quality, quantity, and integration strategy of the knowledge are important factors in the performance. The paper also provides guidelines for human evaluation of knowledge statements and for determining whether a statement is helpful, harmful, or neutral."}
