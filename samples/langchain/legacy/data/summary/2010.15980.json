{"file": "2010.15980.json", "summerization_type": "map_reduce", "summary": " This paper introduces AUTOPROMPT, an automated method for generating prompts for tasks such as sentiment analysis, natural language inference, fact retrieval, and relation extraction. Experiments show that AUTOPROMPT outperforms linear probes and GLUE leaderboard scores on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) task, and that it can be a viable alternative to finetuning in the low-data regime. Examples of prompts generated using AUTOPROMPT are provided, and the results of the tests are also presented."}
