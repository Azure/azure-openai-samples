{"file": "2104.08691.json", "summerization_type": "map_reduce", "summary": " This paper explores the use of prompt tuning, a method of adapting pre-trained language models to downstream tasks, to improve language understanding and natural language processing. It compares the performance of prompt tuning to other methods such as model tuning and prompt design, and finds that it is more parameter efficient and robust to domain shifts. It also discusses the hyperparameter search space and provides the mean and standard deviation of the runtime until convergence for various prompt lengths and model sizes."}
