SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 2003, an estimated 1,334,100 Americans will be 
        diagnosed with some form of cancer.
            (2) In 2003, an estimated 556,500 Americans will die of 
        cancer. In the United States, 1 in every 4 deaths results from 
        cancer.
            (3) In 2002, the National Institutes of Health estimated 
        the overall cost of cancer at $171,600,000,000.
            (4) In 2003, an estimated 211,300 American women and 1,300 
        men will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,200 will die 
        of the disease. A mammogram every 1-2 years can reduce the risk 
        of dying by about 16 percent for women 40 years of age and 
        older.
            (5) In 2003, an estimated 40,100 women will be newly 
        diagnosed with cancer of the uterine corpus and 6,800 women 
        will die of the disease.
            (6) In 2003, an estimated 147,500 Americans will be 
        diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 57,100 will die of the 
        disease.
            (7) Incidence rates of colorectal cancer stabilized between 
        1995 and 1999. Research suggests that declines may be in part 
        due to increased screening and polyp removal.
            (8) The Chronic Disease Prevention Department found that 
        screening for colorectal cancer can reduce the number of deaths 
        by at least 30 percent.
            (9) Regular screening examinations by a health care 
        professional can result in early detection of cancers of the 
        breast, colon, rectum, prostate, testis, oral cavity, and skin. 
        If all these cancers were diagnosed at a localized stage 
        through regular examinations, the 5-year survival rate would 
        increase from 82 percent to 95 percent.
            (10) Cancers of the lung, mouth, larynx, bladder, kidney, 
        cervix, esophagus, and pancreas are related to tobacco use. The 
        American Cancer Society estimates that in 2003 more than 
        180,000 cancer deaths will be caused by tobacco use. Smoking 
        alone causes \1/3\ of all cancer deaths.
            (11) More than 1,000,000 skin cancers expected to be 
        diagnosed in 2003 could have been prevented by protection from 
        the sun's rays.
            (12) An estimated 9,000 new cases of childhood cancer are 
        expected to occur in 2003.
            (13) Cancer is the chief cause of death by disease in 
        children between the ages of 1 and 14.
            (14) The American Cancer Society estimates that 
        approximately \1/3\ of the 556,500 cancer deaths expected in 
        2003 will be related to nutrition, physical inactivity, 
        obesity, and other lifestyle factors that could be prevented.
            (15) About 77 percent of all cancers are diagnosed at age 
        55 and older. In order to ensure high quality cancer care for 
        American seniors, medicare reimbursements must reflect the true 
        cost of treatment in every treatment setting and medicare 
        payments should accurately reflect the cost of drug and 
        biologics as well as the cost of administering drugs and 
        supportive care therapies.
            (16) Despite an aging population, death rates for the most 
        common cancers, lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate continue 
        to drop at an average of 1.7 percent per year.
            (17) In May 2001, Gleevec, the first in what is expected to 
        be a number of cancer treatments, was approved for use by the 
        Food and Drug Administration as it appeared to be effective in 
        stopping the growth of deadly Chronic Myeloid Leukemia cells 
        within 3 months of use. In 2002, Gleevec showed ability to stop 
        growth of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
            (18) In early 2003, researchers used gene chips to 
        accurately predict whether or not breast cancer tumors would 
        spread in the future. If the findings are validated, doctors 
        will be able to determine which patients are likely to relapse 
        and need chemotherapy, while sparing those with a favorable 
        prognosis from additional treatment.
            (19) The Lance Armstrong Foundation, a leading national 
        organization providing services and support for cancer 
        survivors, defines cancer survivorship as living with, through, 
        and beyond cancer.
            (20) In 2001, there were 9,600,000 cancer survivors in the 
        United States.
            (21) Sixty percent of adults diagnosed with cancer survive 
        at least 5 years.
            (22) While nearly every childhood cancer diagnosis 20 years 
        ago was fatal, today more than 80 percent of children diagnosed 
        with cancer survive at least 5 years.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the United States is at a point 
in history in which we must take the proper steps to reach the goal of 
making cancer survivorship the rule and cancer deaths rare by the year 
2015.

It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the current procedure of sending 1 clinical trial 
        through multiple local institutional review boards may not be 
        the most efficient method for the protection of patients 
        enrolled in the trial and may delay the process of bringing 
        lifesaving treatment to cancer patients;
            (2) the National Cancer Institute should be commended for 
        its work in centralizing the institutional review board 
        process; and
            (3) the research community should continue to streamline 
        the institutional review board process in order to bring 
        lifesaving treatments to patients as quickly as possible.
    (c) Patient and Provider Outreach Opportunities With Experimental 
Therapies.--For the purpose of enhancing patient access to experimental 
therapies, the National Cancer Institute shall conduct the following 
activities:
            (1) Integrate, to the maximum extent practicable, trials 
        being conducted by private manufacturers into the National 
        Cancer Institute's clinical trials online database. Such 
        integration may require specific awareness-raising and outreach 
        activities by the National Cancer Institute to private 
        industry.
            (2) Establish an education program which provides patients 
        and providers with--
                    (A) information about how to access and use the 
                National Cancer Institute clinical trials database 
                online; and
                    (B) information about the Food and Drug 
                Administration process for approving the use of drugs 
                and biologics for a single patient.","National Cancer Act of 2003 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop an information-sharing plan for State cancer registries. Modifies provisions concerning preventive health measures with respect to breast and cervical cancers to permit priority to be given to certain projects involving: (1) colorectal cancer screening and outreach. And (2) treating uninsured women diagnosed with cancer during such screening. Authorizes specified waivers of the direct services requirement for breast and cervical cancer screening grants. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to eligible entities to educate cancer patients and their families about medical techniques to reduce and prevent pain, survivorship care and support programs, and related community resources. Requires a national cancer research center to have a practitioner education program that includes pain and symptom management and survivorship care. Amends various provisions of the Act to emphasize the importance of pain and symptom management throughout the nation's cancer programs. Establishes within the National Cancer Institute an Office on Cancer Survivorship. Authorizes the Director of NCI to co-fund grant projects for various cancer programs. Expresses the sense of the Senate with respect to: (1) cancer survivorship, and (2) institutional review board procedures.","A bill to improve data collection and dissemination, treatment, and research relating to cancer, and for other purposes.",19853,1400

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States owes a profound debt to those who 
        have served the United States honorably in the Armed Forces.
            (2) Disabled veterans suffer from a range of physical and 
        mental injuries and disabilities.
            (3) In 2008, the Army reported the highest level of 
        suicides among its soldiers since it began tracking the rate 28 
        years before 2009.
            (4) A scientific study documented in the 2008 Rand Report 
        entitled ``Invisible Wounds of War'' estimated that 300,000 
        veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi 
        Freedom currently suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.
            (5) Veterans have benefitted in multiple ways from the 
        provision of service dogs.
            (6) The Department of Veterans Affairs has been 
        successfully placing guide dogs with the blind since 1961.
            (7) Thousands of dogs around the country await adoption.
    (b) Program Required.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall 
commence a three-year pilot program to assess the benefits, 
feasibility, and advisability of using service dogs for the treatment 
or rehabilitation of veterans with physical or mental injuries or 
disabilities, including post-traumatic stress disorder.
    (c) Partnerships.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot 
        program by partnering with nonprofit organizations that--
                    (A) have experience providing service dogs to 
                individuals with injuries or disabilities;
                    (B) do not charge fees for the dogs, services, or 
                lodging that they provide; and
                    (C) are accredited by a generally accepted 
                industry-standard accrediting institution.
            (2) Reimbursement of costs.--The Secretary shall reimburse 
        partners for costs relating to the pilot program as follows:
                    (A) For the first 50 dogs provided under the pilot 
                program, all costs relating to the provision of such 
                dogs.
                    (B) For dogs provided under the pilot program after 
                the first 50 dogs provided, all costs relating to the 
                provision of every other dog.
    (d) Participation.--
            (1) In general.--As part of the pilot program, the 
        Secretary shall provide a service dog to a number of veterans

                    (A) 200; and
                    (B) the minimum number of such veterans required to 
                produce scientifically valid results with respect to 
                assessing the benefits and costs of the use of such 
                dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of such 
                veterans.
            (2) Composition.--The Secretary shall ensure that--
                    (A) half of the participants in the pilot program

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 
        unemployment rate for recent veterans of military operations in 
        Iraq and Afghanistan was 9.4 percent in February 2013, compared 
        with 7.6 percent in February 2012.
            (2) With the unemployment rate among such veterans higher 
        than the national average and the number of veterans receiving 
        unemployment benefits doubling since 2002, there is a 
        significant need to assist members of the Armed Forces as they 
        transition to the civilian workforce.
            (3) In order to remain competitive in the civilian 
        employment market, members of the Armed Forces and veterans 
        require information about how their military skill sets 
        translate to the requirements of the civilian workforce. 
        Members of the Armed Forces currently receive insufficient or 
        inadequate information during their training for military 
        occupational specialties on translating skills obtained during 
        such training to civilian occupations and credentials.
            (4) In addition, there is a need for enhanced access by 
        accredited credentialing agencies to military training 
        curricula in order to facilitate and enhance the correlation 
        between military training and applicable civilian credentialing 
        courses and exams.
            (5) The information technology sector is one of the fastest 
        growing industries, with tremendous job growth and demand for 
        talented, qualified individuals. The information technology 
        sector has an unemployment rate of 3.5 percent according to a 
        Bureau of Labor Statistics report from February 2013.
            (6) The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a need for 
        110,000 computer support specialists over the next decade. 
        Currently, the size of the information technology workforce in 
        the Armed Forces is about 160,000 members.

SEC. 3. ENHANCEMENT OF MECHANISMS TO CORRELATE SKILLS AND TRAINING FOR 
              MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES WITH SKILLS AND 
              TRAINING REQUIRED FOR CIVILIAN CERTIFICATIONS AND 
              LICENSES.

    (a) Improvement of Information Available to Members of the Armed 
Forces About Correlation.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretaries of the military 
        departments, in coordination with the Under Secretary of 
        Defense for Personnel and Readiness, shall, to the maximum 
        extent practicable, make information on civilian credentialing 
        opportunities available to members of the Armed Forces 
        beginning with, and at every stage of, training of members for 
        military occupational specialties, in order to permit members--
                    (A) to evaluate the extent to which such training 
                correlates with the skills and training required in 
                connection with various civilian certifications and 
                licenses; and

                leads to a certification exam in order to provide a 
                pathway to credentialing opportunities.

1993''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Communications Commission predicts a 
        diminished role for broadcast television and a more prominent 
        role for cable television including pay-per-view.
            (2) Roughly 18,800,000 American homes are equipped to 
        receive pay-per-view and this number is expected to increase to 
        35,900,000 by 1996. Overall pay-per-view revenue is expected to 
        reach $1,100,000,000 by 1996.
            (3) There is a growing trend toward making events available 
        exclusively on pay-per-view.
            (4) As this trend develops, whether the consumer has access 
        to these events will be determined by the ability of the 
        consumer to pay.
            (5) Professional sports leagues are beginning to see pay-
        per-view as a new revenue source to keep pace with escalating 
        player salaries.
            (6) As a result, some media analysts predict that several 
        of broadcast television's premier sports attractions eventually 
        will migrate to pay-per-view.
            (7) Limited access to viewing such events as the ``Super 
        Bowl'' or ``World Series'' would deprive citizens of the 
        ability to enjoy these events which are inherent in the 
        American tradition.
            (8) The majority of facilities in which such events are 
        held are funded through taxpayer money.
            (9) It is unfair that taxpayers, who subsidize the 
        construction and maintenance of many of these facilities, 
        should have to pay an additional pay-per-view charge for 
        viewing these events.
            (10) Nonprofit and public organizations including public 
        and private educational institutions and their athletic 
        organizations are exempt from the corporate income tax.
            (11) Furthermore, corporations can deduct their donations 
        to college sporting events as charitable contributions.
            (12) Tax exempt status is granted to these nonprofit and 
        public organizations by the Federal Government and it is unfair 
        to allow those who use this status to engage in pay-per-view 
        telecasting--thus forcing taxpayers to pay again.
            (13) It is unfair that taxpayers, who subsidize the 
        construction and maintenance of many of these facilities, 
        should have to pay an additional pay-per-view charge for 
        viewing these events.
            (14) Therefore, Congress should ensure that all taxpaying 
        citizens have free access to events that are sponsored by 
        organizations with nonprofit tax exempt status and those events 
        held in taxpayer subsidized facilities.

SEC. 3. PAY-PER-VIEW CHARGES PROHIBITED.

    Section 623 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 543) is 
amended by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection:
    ``(i)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, a cable 
operator may not assess or collect any separate charges for any video 
programming of a sporting, theatrical, or other entertainment event if 
that event is performed at a facility constructed, renovated, or 
maintained with tax revenues or by an organization that receives public 
financial support.
    ``(2) The Commission and local franchising authorities are 
authorized to make determinations concerning the applicability of the 
prohibition contained in paragraph (1). In making such determinations--
            ``(A) a facility shall be considered to have been 
        constructed, maintained, or renovated with tax revenues if--
                    ``(i) tax exempt financing was used to construct, 
                maintain, or renovate the facility,
                    ``(ii) the facility was constructed on land donated 
                by a government, or leased by a government at below

                rescue services;
            ``(B) an event is performed by a nonprofit or public 
        organization that receives tax subsidies if the event is 
        sponsored by, or includes the participation of a team that is a 
        part of, an organization--

                under section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
                and to which donations are tax deductible under such 
                Code; and
            ``(C) notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a facility shall 
        not be considered to have been constructed with tax revenues if 
        the government has been reimbursed, through the proceeds of a 
        sale of the facility or otherwise, for the total amount of the 
        tax revenues that were used to construct the facility, as 
        determined under subparagraph (A), but in this section shall be 
        construed to exempt facilities from this subsection if the 
        facility is receiving current financial support.
    ``(3) The Commission shall prescribe, by regulation, procedures for 
the administration of this subsection.''.","Taxpayer's Right to View Act of 1993 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a cable operator from assessing separate charges for any video programming of a sporting, theatrical, or other entertainment event if that event is performed at a facility constructed, renovated, or maintained with tax revenues or by an organization that receives public financial support. Authorizes the Federal Communications Commission and local franchising authorities to make determinations concerning the applicability of such prohibition. Sets forth conditions under which a facility is considered to have been constructed, maintained, or renovated with tax revenues.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) one in five children entering school in 1993 lives in 
        poverty;
            (2) students from poor families are three times more likely 
        to drop out of school than students from more advantaged homes;
            (3) nearly 40 percent of the females who drop out of school 
        do so as a result of pregnancy;
            (4) in the past two decades, the percentage of women with 
        children under the age of six who are working or seeking 
        employment outside the home has nearly doubled;
            (5) more than 8 million children in this country have no 
        form of health insurance which may lead to untreated 
        conditions, unnecessary diseases and death;
            (6) more than 70 percent of the children who need 
        psychiatric treatment do not receive services;
            (7) children who are victims of child abuse, poverty, 
        malnutrition, lack of health care, alcohol and drug abuse are 
        at risk for failure;
            (8) without health and social intervention, at-risk 
        children are often unable to improve academic performance; and
            (9) to obtain improvements in the educational system, an 
        integrated system which includes comprehensive health and human 
        services for at-risk children and their families is necessary.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--
            (1) to integrate service delivery systems to provide 
        comprehensive public education, training, health and human 
        services to at-risk children at locations accessible to and 
        utilized by such children and their families;
            (2) to achieve systemic reform at the Federal, State, and 
        local levels and to restructure service delivery at the local 
        level; and
            (3) to improve the educational performance of at-risk 
        children.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF FEDERAL INTERAGENCY WORK GROUP.

    (a) In General.--There is established the Federal Interagency Work 
Group composed of the Secretaries of Education, Health and Human 
Services, and Labor and funded equally by the departments of the 
representative Secretaries to facilitate collaboration between agencies 
and to mobilize Federal policy to achieve systemic reform to meet the 
comprehensive needs of at-risk children and to provide grants to the 
States and local entities to develop similar programs at the State and 
local levels.
    (b) Duties.--The Group shall--
            (1) assist Federal, State, and local agencies in 
        developing, implementing, and evaluating service integration 
        programs under this Act;
            (2) to the greatest extent possible, coordinate agency 
        resources and funding allowing for the consolidation of Federal 
        categorical programs, when requests for such waivers are made;
            (3) establish and maintain a national data base that 
        includes the collaborative efforts of the Government, the 
        States, local entities, and private entities to serve at-risk 
        children;
            (4) make grants to the States to develop an interagency 
        work group and fund local efforts to integrate services for at-
        risk youth and their families;
            (5) determine the amounts of each grant by considering how 
        many local project sites the State interagency group can 
        reasonably target with not more than $200,000 allocated to a 
        site; and
            (6) waive certain Federal requirements that impede 
        collaborative efforts if such waivers will result in a more 
        efficient use of resources.
    (c) Fiscal Agent.--The Secretary of Education shall act as the 
fiscal agent for the Group.

SEC. 4. STATE ELIGIBILITY.

    To be eligible to receive a grant under this Act, a State shall--
            (1) establish a State interagency work group between, at a 
        minimum, the departments at the State level that provide public 
        education and health and human services;
            (2) develop preservice and inservice training that assists 
        staff members to understand the communities in which they work 
        and the full array of resources that are available to help at-
        risk children and their families;
            (3) require equal financial or in-kind contributions by the 
        departments referred to in paragraph (1);

12,110_hr1007,"SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The goal of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 
        (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) is to maintain marine mammal species 
        and population stocks at their optimum sustainable populations.
            (2) If the annual removals of individuals of a species or 
        population stock of marine mammals do not exceed the potential 
        biological removal level, the species or population stock will 
        be maintained at, or reach, its optimum sustainable population.
            (3) Requiring that commercial fishermen achieve a zero 
        mortality rate goal for a species or population stock of marine 
        mammals that is equal to or less than 10 percent of the 
        potential biological removal of a given marine mammal species 
        or population stock is unnecessary to achieve that Act's goal 
        of maintaining species and stocks at their optimum sustainable 
        population and penalizes commercial fishermen.
            (4) The Congress intended that the zero mortality rate goal 
        under that Act would be met if fishermen use the best 
        technology that is economically and technologically feasible.
            (5) Species and populations stocks of marine mammal that 
        have reached historic levels are impeding the recovery of 
        endangered species and threatened species through predation or 
        competition in the ecosystem.
            (6) The fundamental principles of ecosystem management are 
        defeated by giving one species a preeminent position in the 
        ecosystem through, imposition of a zero mortality rate goal.
            (7) All persons that interact with marine mammals should 
        seek to reduce and eliminate marine mammal injuries and 
        mortalities through the use of the best equipment and 
        techniques that are economically and technologically feasible.

``SEC. 262. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            ``(1) economic stability would be enhanced, competition 
        between depository institutions would be improved, and the 
        ability of the consumer to make informed decisions regarding 
        deposit accounts, and to verify accounts, would be strengthened 
        if there were uniformity in the disclosure of terms and 
        conditions on which interest is paid and fees are assessed in 
        connection with such accounts; and
            ``(2) consumers lack meaningful choices for managing 
        household funds because--
                    ``(A) despite dissatisfaction with rising account 
                fees at some depository institutions, consumers often 
                find it too difficult to move their funds to new 
                deposit accounts;
                    ``(B) the process of moving funds to new deposit 
                accounts often involves several steps and substantial 
                time to complete, and it is not always clear what the 
                proper procedures are for closing an account at a given 
                depository institution;
                    ``(C) depository institutions have no obligation 
                and may lack the technical capabilities to help 
                consumers transfer automated deposits or debits from 
                old accounts to new accounts, causing delays and 
                confusion;
                    ``(D) depository institutions may charge fees to 
                close an account and withdraw available funds, which 
                can impede banking mobility for low-income consumers; 
                and

                the practice of reopening closed accounts without the 
                consent of the consumer.
    ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            ``(1) to allow consumers to make a meaningful comparison 
        between competing claims of depository institutions with regard 
        to deposit accounts by requiring the clear and uniform

        framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and 
        responsibilities of depository institutions and consumers in 
        closing procedures for certain types of consumer deposit

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to 2013 national health expenditure data, 
        United States health care spending increased 3.6 percent to 
        reach $2.9 trillion, or $9,255 per person, and accounted for 
        17.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
            (2) According to the Institute of Medicine, in 2012 
        estimates of health care costs attributed over 75 percent of 
        national health expenditures to treatment for chronic diseases.
            (3) A March 2003 report from the World Health Organization 
        concluded diet was a major cause of chronic diseases.
            (4) Seven out of 10 deaths among people in the United 
        States each year are from chronic diseases such as 
        cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer.
            (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, in 2013 heart disease was the leading cause of 
        death for American adults. Approximately 600,000 American 
        adults die each year from cardiovascular disease. Coronary 
        heart disease alone costs American taxpayers $108.9 billion 
        each year.
            (6) Research has shown that following a healthful diet can 
        not only reduce symptoms related to cardiovascular disease but 
        can also actually reverse damage done to the arteries.
            (7) According to the Journal of the American Medical 
        Association, two-thirds of adults in the United States are 
        currently overweight, and half of those overweight individuals 
        are obese. One in three children are overweight, and one-fifth 
        of children are obese. The United States spends about $147 to 
        $210 billion a year on obesity related diseases, including type 
        2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and arthritis.
            (8) An estimated 29.1 million people in the United States 
        have diabetes. Another 86 million American adults have 
        prediabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
        predicts that one in three children born in 2000 will develop 
        diabetes at some point in their lives. Total estimated costs of 
        diagnosed diabetes have increased 41 percent, to $245 billion 
        in 2012 from $174 billion in 2007.
            (9) According to the American Cancer Society, there will be 
        an estimated 1,658,370 new cancer cases diagnosed and 589,430 
        cancer deaths in the United States in 2015. That is equivalent 
        to about 1,620 deaths per day and accounts for nearly 1 of 
        every 4 deaths. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 
        (AHRQ) estimates that the direct medical costs for cancer in 
        the United States in 2011 were $88.7 billion.
            (10) According to the Journal of the American College of 
        Nutrition, in 2008 physicians felt inadequately trained to 
        provide proper nutrition advice. Ninety-four percent felt 
        nutrition counseling should be included during primary care 
        visits, but only 14 percent felt adequately trained to provide 
        such counseling.
            (11) A 1985 National Academy of Sciences report recommended 
        that all medical schools require at least 25 contact hours of 
        nutrition education. According to a 2009 national survey of 
        medical colleges published in Academic Medicine, only 38 
        percent of medical schools met these minimum standards by 
        requiring 25 hours of nutrition education as part of their 
        general curricula in 2004. By 2010, that number had shrunk to 
        27 percent. In addition, 30 percent of United States medical 
        schools required a dedicated nutrition course in 2004. Most 
        recently, only 25 percent of such schools required such a 
        course in 2010.
            (12) According to the Journal of Nutrition in Clinical 
        Practice in 2010, more than half of graduating medical students 
        felt their nutrition education was insufficient.

        Nation--includes a goal (NWS-6) to increase the proportion of 
        physician office visits that include counseling or education 
        related to nutrition or weight. According to Healthy People 
        2020, only 13.8 percent of physician office visits included 
        counseling about nutrition or diet (2010 latest year 
        available).
            (14) According to Mission: Readiness, one in four Americans 
        cannot serve in the military due to weight. For those serving, 
        the military discharged 4,300 active-duty personnel due to 
        weight problems in 2012.
            (15) According to the Journal of American Health Promotion, 
        the military spends well over $1 billion a year to treat 
        weight-related health problems such as heart disease and 
        diabetes through its TRICARE health insurance for active duty 
        personnel, reservists, retirees and their families.
            (16) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, American Indian or Alaska Native adults are 60 
        percent more likely to be obese and over twice as likely as to 
        have diabetes compared to White adults.
            (17) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, American Indian or Alaska Native adults have the 
        highest rate of diabetes among all minority groups at 15.9 
        percent.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Recreational Hunting Safety and 
Preservation Act of 1993''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) recreational hunting, when carried out pursuant to law 
        (as implemented by the regulations of Federal and State 
        wildlife management agencies) is a necessary and beneficial 
        element in the proper conservation and management of healthy, 
        abundant, and biologically diverse wildlife resources;
            (2) recreational hunters (because of a generally 
        demonstrated concern with the conservation of wildlife 
        resources and preservation of habitat necessary for the 
        breeding and maintenance of healthy wildlife populations, and 
        through a familiarity with the resources gained from experience 
        in the field) are a valuable asset in ensuring enlightened 
        public input into decisions regarding management and 
        maintenance programs for wildlife resources and habitat;
            (3)(A) recreational hunting supports industries highly 
        significant to the national economy through sales in interstate 
        commerce of sporting goods; and
            (B) the Federal excise taxes imposed on the sales provide a 
        major source of funding for vital programs of wildlife 
        conservation and management;
            (4) various persons are engaging in (and have announced an 
        intent to continue to engage in) a variety of disruptive 
        activities with the premeditated purpose of preventing and 
        interfering with the conduct of lawful recreational hunting on 
        Federal lands, which activities--
                    (A) place both recreational hunters and the 
                disruptive persons in imminent jeopardy of grave 
                physical injury or death;
                    (B) disrupt the peaceful, lawful, and prudent 
                conduct of wildlife population and habitat management 
                programs by Federal and State wildlife management 
                agencies; and
                    (C) ultimately may alter the planned program 
                objectives, resulting in--
                            (i) undesirable patterns of activity within 
                        populations of wildlife;
                            (ii) the endangerment of the future 
                        viability of wildlife species; and
                            (iii) damage to habitat values;
            (5) Federal lands comprise important wildlife habitat 
        resources that--
                    (A) support many large, diverse, and vital 
                populations of wildlife; and
                    (B) offer significant opportunities for legal 
                recreational hunting as an important management tool to 
                ensure the future viability of the wildlife 
                populations;
            (6) it is the right of citizens of the United States freely 
        to enjoy lawful recreational hunting on Federal lands in 
        accordance with regulations promulgated by Federal and State 
        wildlife management agencies; and
            (7) in many instances under current law, vagueness and 
        ambiguity exist regarding the application of State laws and 
        enforcement activities relating to--
                    (A) the safety of hunters; and
                    (B) the legal rights of recreational hunters to 
                participate peacefully in lawful hunts on Federal 
                lands.
