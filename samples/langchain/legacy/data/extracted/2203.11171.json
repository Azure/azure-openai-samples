Chit, Sharan Narangt, Aakanksha Chowdheryt, Denny Zhouts + Google Research, Brain Team #xuezhiw@google.com, $dennyzhou@google.com ABSTRACT Chain-of-thought prompting combined with pre-trained large language models has achieved encouraging results on complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose a new decoding strategy, self-consistency, to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. It first samples a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths. Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that self-consistency boosts the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with a striking margin on a range of popular arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K (+17.9%), SVAMP (+11.0%), AQUA (+12.2%), StrategyQA (+6.4%) and ARC-challenge (+3.9%). arXiv:2203.11171v3 [cs.CL] 4 Oct 2022 1 INTRODUCTION Although language models have demonstrated remarkable success across a range of NLP tasks, their ability to demonstrate reasoning is often seen as a limitation, which cannot be overcome solely by increasing model scale (Rae et al., 2021; BIG-bench collaboration, 2021, inter alia). In an effort to address this shortcoming, Wei et al. (2022) have proposed chain-of-thought prompting, where a language model is prompted to generate a series of short sentences that mimic the reasoning process a person might employ in solving a task. For example, given the question \"If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\", instead of directly responding with \"5\", a language model would be prompted to respond with the entire chain-of-thought: \"There are 3 cars in the parking lot already. 2 more arrive. Now there are 3 + 2 = 5 cars. The answer is 5.\". It has been observed that chain-of-thought prompting significantly improves model performance across a variety of multi-step reasoning tasks (Wei et al., 2022). In this paper, we introduce a novel decoding strategy called self-consistency to replace the greedy decoding strategy used in chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022), that further improves language models' reasoning performance by a significant margin. Self-consistency leverages the intuition that complex reasoning tasks typically admit multiple reasoning paths that reach a correct answer (Stanovich & West, 2000). The more that deliberate thinking and analysis is required for a problem (Evans, 2010), the greater the diversity of reasoning paths that can recover the answer. Figure 1 illustrates the self-consistency method with an example. We first prompt the language model with chain-of-thought prompting, then instead of greedily decoding the optimal reasoning path, we propose a \"sample-and-marginalize\" decoding procedure: we first sample from the language model's decoder to generate a diverse set of reasoning paths; each reasoning path might lead to a different final answer, so we determine the optimal answer by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths to find the most consistent answer in the final answer set. Such an approach is analogous to the human experience that if multiple different ways of thinking lead to the same answer, one has greater confidence that the final answer is correct. Compared to other decoding methods, self-consistency avoids the repetitiveness and local-optimality that plague greedy decoding, while mitigating the stochasticity of a single sampled generation. 1"}, {"page_number": 2, "page_content": "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models Chain-of-thought prompting Prompt Self-consistency Q: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?

She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder for $2 per egg. How much does she make every day? A: Language model Language model Greedy decode This means she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs every day. She sells the remainder for $2 per egg, so in total she sells 7 * $2 = $14 per day. The answer is $14.

She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 left. Then she bakes muffins, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left. So she has 9 eggs * $2 = $18. I The answer is $18. Figure 1: The self-consistency method contains three steps: (1) prompt a language model using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting; (2) replace the \"greedy decode\" in CoT prompting by sampling from the language model's decoder to generate a diverse set of reasoning paths; and (3) marginalize out the reasoning paths and aggregate by choosing the most consistent answer in the final answer set. Self-consistency is far simpler than prior approaches that either train an additional verifier (Cobbe et al., 2021) or train a re-ranker given additional human annotations to improve generation quality (Thoppilan et al., 2022). Instead, self-consistency is entirely unsupervised, works off-the-shelf with pre-trained language models, requires no additional human annotation, and avoids any additional training, auxiliary models or fine-tuning. Self-consistency also differs from a typical ensemble approach where multiple models are trained and the outputs from each model are aggregated, it acts more like a \"self-ensemble\" that works on top of a single language model. We evaluate self-consistency on a wide range of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks over four language models with varying scales: the public UL2-20B (Tay et al., 2022) and GPT-3-175B (Brown et al., 2020), and two densely-activated decoder-only language models: LaMDA-137B (Thoppilan et al., 2022) and PaLM-540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022). On all four language models, self-consistency improves over chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) by a striking margin across all tasks. In particular, when used with PaLM-540B or GPT-3, self-consistency achieves new state-of-the-art levels of performance across arithmetic reasoning tasks, including GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) (+17.9% absolute accuracy gains), SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021) (+11.0%), AQUA (Ling et al., 2017) (+12.2%), and across commonsense reasoning tasks such as StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) (+6.4%) and ARC-challenge (Clark et al., 2018) (+3.9%). In additional experiments, we show self-consistency can robustly boost performance on NLP tasks where adding a chain-of-thought might hurt performance compared to standard prompting (Ye & Durrett, 2022). We also show self- consistency significantly outperforms sample-and-rank, beam search, ensemble-based approaches, and is robust to sampling strategies and imperfect prompts. 2 SELF-CONSISTENCY OVER DIVERSE REASONING PATHS A salient aspect of humanity is that people think differently. It is natural to suppose that in tasks requiring deliberate thinking, there are likely several ways to attack the problem. We propose that such a process can be simulated in language models via sampling from the language model's decoder. For instance, as shown in Figure 1, a model can generate several plausible responses to a math question that all arrive at the same correct answer (Outputs 1 and 3). Since language models are not perfect reasoners, the model might also produce an incorrect reasoning path or make a mistake in one of the reasoning steps (e.g., in Output 2), but such solutions are less likely to arrive at the same answer. That is, we hypothesize that correct reasoning processes, even if they are diverse, tend to have greater agreement in their final answer than incorrect processes. We leverage this intuition by proposing the following self-consistency method. First, a language model is prompted with a set of manually written chain-of-thought exemplars (Wei et al., 2022).

Self-consistency is compatible with most existing sampling algorithms, including temperature sampling (Ackley et al., 1985; Ficler & Goldberg, 2017), top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018; Holtzman et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019), and nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020). Finally, we aggregate the answers by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths and choosing the answer that is the most consistent among the generated answers. In more detail, assume the generated answers aj are from a fixed answer set, aj E A, where i = 1, ... , m indexes the m candidate outputs sampled from the decoder. Given a prompt and a question, self-consistency introduces an additional latent variable ri, which is a sequence of tokens representing the reasoning path in the i-th output, then couples the generation of (ri, aj) where ri -> aj, i.e., generating a reasoning path r\u00bf is optional and only used to reach the final answer aj. As an example, consider Output 3 from Figure 1: the first few sentences \"She eats 3 for breakfast ... So she has 9 eggs * $2 = $18.\" constitutes ri, while the answer 18 from the last sentence, \"The answer is $18\", is parsed as aj.1 Now given a certain answer a, self-consistency applies a marginalization over ri after sampling a diverse set of (r\u00bf, a\u00bf) from the language model's decoder, so the probability of a given by the above generation process is (we omit the normalization factor since it is a constant): P(a | prompt, question) = m 1(aj =a)P(r\u00bf, aj | prompt, question). (1) To compute P(ri, aj | prompt, question), we can either take the unnormalized probability of the language model generating (ri, aj) given (prompt, question), or we can normalize the conditional probability by the output length (Brown et al., 2020), i.e., P(ri, ai | prompt, question) = exp k 2k=1 log P(tk |prompt,question, t1, ... , tk-1) (2) where log P(tk | prompt, question, t1, ... , tk-1) is the log probability of generating the k-th token tk in (ri, ai) conditioned on the previous tokens, and K is the total number of tokens in (ri, ai). As the last step, we choose the optimal answer by picking a with the maximum P(a | prompt, question), or as we defined as the most \"consistent\" answer among the final answer set. In Table 1, we show the accuracy over a set of reasoning tasks by using different answer ag- gregation strategies. First, Equation 1 corresponds to a \"weighted sum\" over aj with weights P(ri, aj | prompt, question), and results in Table 1 show that the \"normalized\" weighted sum (i.e., Equation 2) gives a much higher accuracy compared to its unnormalized counterpart. In addition, per- haps surprisingly, we found that taking the \"unweighted sum\", i.e., taking a majority vote directly over a\u00bf (i.e., EI1, 1 (ai = a)) gives a very similar accuracy as calculating the exact normalized weighted sum. We took a closer look at the model's output probabilities and found that for each (rj, ai), the normalized conditional probabilities P(ri, aj | prompt, question) are quite close to each other, i.e., the language model regards those generations as \"equally likely\".2 Hence for self-consistency in practice, one can either calculate the exact normalized weighted sum (Equation 1 and 2) or take a majority vote over aj directly as an approximation, where the latter has a strictly lower computational cost. In our experiments, for simplicity we use majority vote to report all results. For completeness, 1 The parser is task dependent. For arithmetic reasoning, we parse the first numerical part as the final answer after the model generates \"The answer is \". For commonsense reasoning, we parse the full string answer as the final answer after the model generates \"The answer is \". Most generated outputs have a consistent format of \"{Reasoning paths }. The answer is X.\" if we prompt the language model in this format. 2This also means that the language model is not well calibrated and thus cannot distinguish well between correct solutions and wrong solutions, which also explains why additional re-rankers were trained to better judge the quality of the solutions in previous work (Cobbe et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022)."}, {"page_number": 4, "page_content": "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models in Table 1 we also report the results by taking a \"weighted average\", i.e., each a gets a score of its weighted sum divided by i1 1 (aj = a), which results in a much worse performance. Self-consistency explores an interesting space between open-ended text generation and optimal text generation with a fixed answer. Reasoning tasks typically have fixed answers, which is why researchers have generally considered greedy decoding approaches (Radford et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022). However, we have found that even when the desired answer is fixed, introducing diversity in the reasoning processes can be highly beneficial; therefore we leverage sampling, as commonly used for open-ended text generation (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Thoppilan et al., 2022), to achieve this goal. One should note that self-consistency can be applied only to problems where the final answer is from a fixed answer set, but in principle this approach can be extended to open-text generation problems if a good metric of consistency can be defined between multiple generations, e.g., whether two answers agree or contradict each other. 3 EXPERIMENTS We conducted a series of experiments to compare the proposed self-consistency method with existing approaches on a range of reasoning benchmarks. We find that self-consistency robustly improves reasoning accuracy for every language model considered, spanning a wide range of model scales. 3.1 EXPERIMENT SETUP Tasks and datasets. We evaluate self-consistency on the following reasoning benchmarks.3 . Arithmetic reasoning. For these tasks, we used the Math Word Problem Repository (Koncel- Kedziorski et al., 2016), including AddSub (Hosseini et al., 2014), MultiArith (Roy & Roth, 2015), and ASDiv (Miao et al., 2020). We also included AQUA-RAT (Ling et al., 2017), a recently published benchmark of grade-school-math problems (GSM8K; Cobbe et al., 2021), and a challenge dataset over math word problems (SVAMP; Patel et al., 2021). \u00b7 Commonsense reasoning. For these tasks, we used CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2019), StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021), and the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) (Clark et al., 2018). \u00b7 Symbolic Reasoning. We evaluate two symbolic reasoning tasks: last letter concatenation (e.g., the input is \"Elon Musk\" and the output should be \"nk\"), and Coinflip (e.g., a coin is heads-up, after a few flips is the coin still heads-up?) from Wei et al. (2022). Language models and prompts. We evaluate self-consistency over four transformer-based lan- guage models with varying scales: \u00b7 UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) is an encoder-decoder model trained on a mixture of denoisers with 20- billion parameters. UL2 is completely open-sourced4 and has similar or better performance than GPT-3 on zero-shot SuperGLUE, with only 20B parameters and thus is more compute-friendly; \u00b7 GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with 175-billion parameters. We use two public engines code-davinci- 001 and code-davinci-002 from the Codex series (Chen et al., 2021) to aid reproducibility;5 \u00b7 LaMDA-137B (Thoppilan et al., 2022) is a dense left-to-right, decoder-only language model with 137-billion parameters, pre-trained on a mixture of web documents, dialog data and Wikipedia; \u00b7 PaLM-540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022) is a dense left-to-right, decoder-only language model with 540-billion parameters, pre-trained on a high quality corpus of 780 billion tokens with filtered webpages, books, Wikipedia, news articles, source code, and social media conversations. We perform all experiments in the few-shot setting, without training or fine-tuning the language models. For a fair comparison we use the same prompts as in Wei et al. (2022): for all arithmetic reasoning tasks we use the same set of 8 manually written exemplars; for each commonsense reasoning task, 4-7 exemplars are randomly chosen from the training set with manually composed chain-of-thought prompts.6 Full details on the prompts used are given in Appendix A.2. 3By default we use the test split for all datasets if the labels are available for evaluation. For CommonsenseQA we use the dev split; for StrategyQA we use the question-only set from BIG-bench collaboration (2021): https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/tree/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/strategyqa. 4Model checkpoints at https: //github. com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/ul2. 5 Public API available at https : //openai. com/api /. Self-consistency is robust to different sets of prompts and we provide a study in Appendix A.1.2."}, {"page_number": 5, "page_content": "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models Sampling scheme. To sample diverse reasoning paths, we followed similar settings to those suggested in Radford et al. (2019); Holtzman et al. (2020) for open-text generation. In particular, for UL2-20B and LaMDA-137B we applied temperature sampling with T = 0.5 and truncated at the top-k (k = 40) tokens with the highest probability, for PaLM-540B we applied T = 0.7, k = 40, and for GPT-3 we use T = 0.7 without top-k truncation. We provide an ablation study in Section 3.5 to show that self-consistency is generally robust to sampling strategies and parameters. 3.2 MAIN RESULTS We report the results of self-consistency averaged over 10 runs, where we sampled 40 outputs independently from the decoder in each run. The baseline we compare to is chain-of-thought prompting with greedy decoding (Wei et al., 2022), referred to as CoT-prompting, which has been previously used for decoding in large language models (Chowdhery et al., 2022). Arithmetic Reasoning The results are shown in Table 2.7 Self-consistency improves the arithmetic reasoning performance over all four language models significantly over chain-of-thought prompting. More surprisingly, the gains become more significant when the language model's scale increases, e.g., we see +3%-6% absolute accuracy improvement over UL2-20B but +9%-23% improvement for LaMDA-137B and GPT-3. For larger models that already achieve high accuracy on most tasks (e.g., GPT-3 and PaLM-540B), self-consistency still contributes significant additional gains with +12%-18% absolute accuracy on tasks like AQuA and GSM8K, and +7%-11% on SVAMP and ASDiv. With self-consistency, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on almost all tasks: despite the fact that self-consistency is unsupervised and task-agnostic, these results compare favorably to existing approaches that require task-specific training, or fine-tuning with thousands of examples (e.g., on GSM8K).

The best performance for each task is shown in bold. Commonsense and Symbolic Reasoning Table 3 shows the results on commonsense and symbolic reasoning tasks. Similarly, self-consistency yields large gains across all four language models, and obtained SoTA results on 5 out of 6 tasks. For symbolic reasoning, we test the out-of-distribution (OOD) setting where the input prompt contains examples of 2-letters or 2-flips but we test examples of 4-letters and 4-flips (this setting is more challenging as PaLM-540B or GPT-3 can already achieve perfect in-distribution accuracy). In this challenging OOD setting, the gain of self-consistency is still quite significant compared to CoT-prompting with sufficient model sizes. To show the effect of the number of sampled reasoning paths, we plot the accuracy (mean and standard deviation over 10 runs) with respect to varying numbers of sampled paths (1, 5, 10, 20, 40) in Figure 2.

He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops? Yes or no: Is Albany, Georgia the most populous US Albany? Greedy Decode He traveled 60 miles in total. He stopped after 20 miles, so he traveled 60 - 20 = 40 miles between the first and second stops. The answer is 40. Albany, Georgia is the most populous US Al- bany. Thus, the answer is yes. Sampled Path 1 Henry travelled a total of 60 miles. His first stop was 20 miles in, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end. So between his first and second stops he travelled 60 - 20 -15 = 25 miles. The answer is 25. The most populous US Albany is Albany, New York. Thus, Albany, Georgia is not the most populous US Albany. So the answer is no. Sampled Path 2 He made two stops during a 60-mile trip. The first was 20 miles into the trip. The second was 15 miles before the end of the trip. This means the second stop was 60 - 15 = 45 miles into the trip. Since he made the stops in order, the second stop must have been 45 - 20 = 25 miles after the first stop. The answer is 25. Albany, Georgia has a population of about 88,000. Albany, New York has a population of about 95,000. Thus, Albany, Georgia is not the most populous US Albany. So the answer is no.

Two sampled reasoning paths that are consistent with the ground truth are shown. 3.3 SELF-CONSISTENCY HELPS WHEN CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT HURTS PERFORMANCE Ye & Durrett (2022) show that sometimes chain-of-thought prompting might hurt performance compared to standard prompting in few-shot in-context learning. Here we perform a study using self-consistency to see if it can help fill in the gap, over a set of common NLP tasks, including (1) Closed-Book Question Answering: BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), and (2) Natural Language Inference: e-SNLI (Camburu et al., 2018), ANLI (Nie et al., 2020) and RTE (Dagan et al., 2005; Bar-Haim et al., 2006; Giampiccolo et al., 2007; Bentivogli et al., 2009). The results over PaLM-540B are shown in Table 5. For some tasks (e.g., ANLI-R1, e-SNLI, RTE), adding chain-of-thought does hurt performance compared to standard prompting (Brown et al., 2020),"}, {"page_number": 7, "page_content": "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models but self-consistency is able to robustly boost the performance and outperform standard prompting, making it a reliable way to add rationales in few-shot in-context learning for common NLP tasks.

Comparison to Sample-and-Rank One commonly used approach to improve generation quality is sample-and-rank, where multiple sequences are sampled from the decoder and then ranked according to each sequence's log probability (Adiwardana et al., 2020). We compare self-consistency with sample-and-rank on GPT-3 code-davinci-001, by sampling the same number of sequences from the decoder as self-consistency and taking the final answer from the top-ranked sequence. The results are shown in Figure 3. While sample-and-rank does improve the accuracy with additionally sampled sequences and ranking, the gain is much smaller compared to self-consistency. 24 22 20 18 Accuracy (%) GSM8K MultiArith 80 75 \u226570 Accuracy (%) 65 ARC (Challenge) 55 50 >45 Accuracy (%) 16 60 14 55 12 50 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 #Sampled Reasoning Paths 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 #Sampled Reasoning Paths 40 - Self Consistency (Multi-path) 35 - Sample & Rank (Multi-path) Greedy Decode (Single-path) 30 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 #Sampled Reasoning Paths Figure 3: Self-consistency significantly outperforms sample-and-rank with the same # of samples. Comparison to Beam Search In Table 6, we compare self-consistency with beam search decoding on the UL2-20B model. For a fair comparison we report the accuracy under the same number of beams and reasoning paths. On both tasks self-consistency outperforms beam search significantly. Note self-consistency can also adopt beam search to decode each reasoning path (results are shown as \"Self-consistency using beam search\"), but its performance is worse compared to self-consistency with sampling. The reason is that beam search yields a lower diversity in the outputs (Li & Jurafsky, 2016), while in self-consistency the diversity of the reasoning paths is the key to a better performance.

Comparison to Ensemble-based Approaches We further compare self-consistency to ensemble- based methods for few-shot learning. In particular, we consider ensembling by: (1) prompt order permutation: we randomly permute the exemplars in the prompt 40 times to mitigate model's sensitivity to prompt order (Zhao et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021); and (2) multiple sets of prompts (Gao et al., 2021): we manually write 3 different sets of prompts. We took majority vote of the answers from greedy decoding in both approaches as an ensemble. Table 7 shows that compared to self-consistency, existing ensemble-based approaches achieve a much smaller gain.8 In addition, note that self-consistency is different from a typical model-ensemble approach, where multiple models 8 Self-consistency is compatible with both ensemble approaches and we show the results in Appendix A.1.4."}, {"page_number": 8, "page_content": "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models are trained and their outputs are aggregated. Self-consistency acts more like a \"self-ensemble\" on top of a single language model. We additionally show the results of ensembling multiple models in Appendix A.1.3 where the model-ensembles perform much worse compared to self-consistency.

Self-Consistency is Robust to Sampling Strategies/Parameters and Scaling We show self- consistency is robust to sampling strategies and parameters, by varying T in temperature sampling (Ackley et al., 1985; Ficler & Goldberg, 2017), k in top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018; Holtzman et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019), and p in nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020), over PaLM-540B in Figure 4 (left). Figure 4 (right) shows that self-consistency robustly improves performance across all scales for the LaMDA-137B model series. The gain is relatively lower for smaller models due to certain abilities (e.g., arithmetic) only emerge when the model reaches a sufficient scale (Brown et al., 2020). 76 72 68 64 Accuracy (%) 60 - T=0.7, k=40 - T=0.5, k=40 - T=0.3, k=40 -+ T=0.7, k=20 - T=0.7, no top k - p=0.95 25 Self Consistency Greedy Decode 20 Accuracy (%) 56 52 48 44 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 #Sampled Reasoning Paths p=0.9 Greedy Decode 15 10 5 1 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 Model size (#param in billions) Figure 4: GSM8K accuracy. (Left) Self-consistency is robust to various sampling strategies and parameters. (Right) Self-consistency improves performance across language model scales. Self-Consistency Improves Robustness to Imperfect Prompts For few-shot learning with man- ually constructed prompts, human annotators sometimes make minor mistakes when creating the prompts. We further study if self-consistency can help improve a language model's robustness to imperfect prompts.9 We show the results in Table 8: while imperfect prompts decrease accuracy with greedy decoding (17.1 -> 14.9), self-consistency can fill in the gaps and robustly improve the results. Additionally, we found that the consistency (in terms of % of decodes agreeing with the final aggregated answer) is highly correlated with accuracy (Figure 5, over GSM8K). This suggests that one can use self-consistency to provide an uncertainty estimate of the model in its generated solutions. In other words, one can use low consistency as an indicator that the model has low confidence; i.e., self-consistency confers some ability for the model to \"know when it doesn't know\". Self-Consistency Works for Non-Natural-Language Reasoning Paths and Zero-shot CoT We also tested the generality of the self-consistency concept to alternative forms of intermediate reasoning like equations (e.g., from \"There are 3 cars in the parking lot already. 2 more arrive. Now there are 3 + 2 = 5 cars.\" to \"3 + 2 = 5\"). The results are shown in Table 8 (\"Prompt with equations\"): self-consistency still improves accuracy by generating intermediate equations; however, compared to generating natural language reasoning paths, the gain is smaller since the equations are much shorter \"We use the same prompts as before, but swap all the numbers in the reasoning paths with random numbers except the final answer, e.g., from \"There are 3 cars in the parking lot already. 2 more arrive. Now there are 3 + 2 = 5 cars.\" to \"There are 7 cars in the parking lot already. 6 more arrive. Now there are 7 + 6 = 5 cars.\"."}, {"page_number": 9, "page_content": "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models Prompt with correct chain-of-thought 17.1 Prompt with imperfect chain-of-thought 14.9 + Self-consistency (40 paths) 23.4 LaMDA-137B Prompt with equations 5.0 + Self-consistency (40 paths) 6.5 Zero-shot CoT (Kojima et al., 2022) 43.0 + Self-consistency (40 paths) 69.2 100 80 60 Accuracy (%) PaLM-540B Table 8: Self-consistency works under imperfect prompts, equa- tion prompts and zero-shot chain-of-thought for GSM8K. 40 20 0 0 20 40 60 80 100 Consistency (%) Figure 5: The consistency is cor- related with model's accuracy. and less opportunity remains for generating diversity in the decoding process.

Language models are known to struggle in Type 2 tasks, such as arithmetic, logical and commonsense reasoning (Evans, 2010). Previous work has primarily focused on specialized approaches for improving reasoning (Andor et al., 2019; Ran et al., 2019; Geva et al., 2020; Pi\u0119kos et al., 2021). Compared to prior work, self-consistency is applicable to a wide range of reasoning tasks without any additional supervision or fine-tuning, while still substantially improving the performance of the chain-of-thought prompting approach proposed in Wei et al. (2022). Sampling and re-ranking in language models. Multiple decoding strategies for language models have been proposed in the literature, e.g., temperature sampling (Ackley et al., 1985; Ficler & Goldberg, 2017), top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018; Holtzman et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019), nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020), minimum Bayes risk decoding (Eikema & Aziz, 2020), and typical decoding (Meister et al., 2022). Other work has sought to explicitly promote diversity in the decoding process (Batra et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016; Vijayakumar et al., 2018). Re-ranking is another common approach to improve generation quality in language models (Adiwar- dana et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2021). Thoppilan et al. (2022) collect additional human annotations to train a re-ranker for response filtering. Cobbe et al. (2021) train a \"verifier\" to re-rank generated solutions, which substantially improves the solve rate on math tasks compared to just fine-tuning the language model. Elazar et al. (2021) improve the consistency of factual knowledge extraction by extending pre-training with an additional consistency loss. All these methods require either training an additional re-ranker or collecting additional human annotation, while self-consistency requires no additional training, fine-tuning, nor extra data collection. Extract reasoning paths. Some previous work has considered task-specific approaches for iden- tifying reasoning paths, such as constructing semantic graphs (Xu et al., 2021a), learning an RNN to retrieve reasoning paths over the Wikipedia graph (Asai et al., 2020), fine-tuning with human annotated reasoning paths on math problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), or training an extractor with heuristic-based pseudo reasoning paths (Chen et al., 2019). More recently, the importance of di- versity in the reasoning processes has been noticed, but only leveraged via task-specific training, either through an additional QA model over extracted reasoning paths (Chen et al., 2019), or by the introduction of latent variables in a commonsense knowledge graph (Yu et al., 2022). Compared to these approaches, self-consistency is far simpler and requires no additional training. The approach we propose simply couples the generation of reasoning paths and a final answer by sampling from the decoder, using aggregation to recover the most consistent answer without additional modules. Consistency in language models. Some prior work has shown that language models can suffer from inconsistency in conversation (Adiwardana et al., 2020), explanation generation (Camburu et al., 2020), and factual knowledge extraction (Elazar et al., 2021). Welleck et al. (2020) use \"consistency\" to refer to generating an infinite-length sequence in recurrent language models. Nye et al. (2021) improve the logical consistency of samples from a System 1 model by adding a System 2-inspired logical reasoning module. In this paper we focus on a slightly different notion of \"consistency\", i.e., utilizing answer consistency among diverse reasoning paths to improve accuracy."}, {"page_number": 10, "page_content": "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models 5 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION We introduced a simple yet effective method called self-consistency, and observed that it significantly improves accuracy in a range of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, across four large language models with varying scales. Beyond accuracy gains, self-consistency is also useful for collecting rationales when performing reasoning tasks with language models, and for providing uncertainty estimates and improved calibration of language model outputs. One limitation of self-consistency is that it incurs more computation cost. In practice people can try a small number of paths (e.g., 5 or 10) as a starting point to realize most of the gains while not incurring too much cost, as in most cases the performance saturates quickly (Figure 2). As part of future work, one could use self-consistency to generate better supervised data to fine-tune the model, such that the model can give more accurate predictions in a single inference run after fine-tuning. In addition, we observed that language models can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical reasoning paths (e.g., the strategy QA example in Table 4, the two population numbers are not exactly correct), and further work is needed to better ground models' rationale generations.

Note this is a typical ensemble approach (averaging over the predictions over multiple models) and it achieves a performance significantly worse than self-consistency (self-consistency over PaLM-540B gets an accuracy of 74.4%), as lower-capacity models drag down the performance of higher-capacity models. In addition, this approach is limited in two ways: 1) It requires multiple models for an ensemble which might not always be available, while self-consistency only requires one single model to \"self-ensemble\"; 2) If one of the models is much weaker, it can actually hurt the final performance.

Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket? (a) 45 (b) 90 (c) 120 (d) 150 (e) 180 [CommonsenseQA] The man laid on the soft moss and looked up at the trees, where was the man? (a) niagra falls (b) forest (c) waterfall (d) ground (e) tree [ARC] Which of these will most likely harm a habitat? (a) plant- ing trees. (b) water pollution. (c) rainfall. (d) sunlight. [ARC-challenge] Which pro- cess in the carbon cycle takes the longest to complete? (a) emis- sion of waste. (b) respiration in animals. (c) photosynthesis in plants. (d) formation of fossil fu- els. Greedy Decode Sam had 10 socks. He threw away 3 old ones that didn't fit. He bought 36 new ones. That means he has 10 + 36 - 3 = 41 socks. The answer is 41. There are 697 girls and the rest are boys. That means there are 697 + 228 = 925 girls. The rest are boys. So the number of boys is 925 - 697 = 228. The answer is 228. There are 10 oranges in a bas- ket. So there are 10 ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket. The answer must be something that is soft and mossy. Of the above choices, only ground is soft and mossy. So the answer is (d). Planting trees will not harm a habitat. So the answer is (a). The process of photosynthesis in plants takes the longest to complete. So the answer is (c). Sampled Path 1 Sam had 10 socks. He threw away 3 old ones. So now he has 7 left. Then he bought 36 new ones. So now he has 7 + 36 = 43 socks. The answer is 43. The number of boys is the difference between 697 and 228. This is 697 - 228 = 469. The answer is 469. There are 10 oranges in a basket. We need to choose 2 oranges from the basket. So the number of ways are 10C2. So the answer is (a). The answer must be somewhere where moss is found. Of the above choices, only forests are known for having moss. So the answer is (b). The answer is (b), water pollution, because it will most likely harm the habi- tat. The other answers are not likely to harm the habi- tat. The formation of fossil fu- els takes the longest time to complete. So the an- swer is (d). Sampled Path 2 He had 10 socks. He threw away 3 old ones that didn't fit. He bought 36 new ones. So in total he has 10 - 3 + 36 = 43 socks. The answer is 43. In the beginning there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. So, the number of boys must be 697 - 228 = 469 boys. The answer is 469. There are 10 oranges in the bas- ket. If you choose 2 oranges, you have 10C2 = 45 ways of choosing 2 oranges. So the answer is (a). The answer must be a place where the man is laying down and look- ing up at trees. Of the above choices, only forest is a place where people lay down and look at trees. So the answer is (b). The answer is (b), water pollution. Trees are good for a habitat, rain- fall is necessary for a habitat, and sunlight is necessary for a habitat. So the answer is (b). The process that takes the longest time to complete is the forma- tion of fossil fuels, which hap- pens over millions of years. So the answer is (d).

A.2 FULL SETS OF PROMPTS We list the full details of the prompts used for two newly-introduced datasets, AQUA-RAT (Ling et al., 2017) and AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) (Clark et al., 2018), where we manually composed the example chains of thought in this paper, in Table 14 and Table 15, respectively. As additional information, we also list the exact set of prompts used for all arithmetic reasoning tasks in Table 17, since there are multiple sets of prompts introduced in Wei et al. (2022). The prompts for CommonsenseQA and StrategyQA are the same as used in Wei et al. (2022). We provide the exact prompts used for common NLP tasks in the following tables as well, including NLI and Closed-Book Question-Answering tasks."}, {"page_number": 19, "page_content": "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models Question Greedy Decode Sampled Path 1 Sampled Path 2 [GSM8K] Kyle bought last year's best-selling book for $19.50. This is with a 25% dis- count from the original price. What was the original price of the book? The book was sold for $19.50. This is 25% less than the origi- nal price. This means the original price was 100%. 25% of 100% is 25%. So the original price was 100% - 25% = 75%. The The original price of the book is $19.50. Since it was dis- counted by 25%, the original price was 19.50 / 0.75 = 26. The answer is 26. Kyle bought a book that is sold for $19.50. With a 25% discount, the original price must be higher. If we call the original price x, then the discounted price is 0.75x. Since this is $19.50, we can write 0.75x = 19.50. Solving this, we find that the original price is x = 19.50 / 0.75 = $26. The answer is $26. original price was 75% of $19.50. 75% of $19.50 is 75% * $19.50 = $14.625. The answer is $14.625. [AQUA] The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m x 6 m x 2.5 m) is (a) 120 litres (b) 1200 litres (c) 12000 litres (d) 120000 litres (e) None of these The volume of the tank is 8 m * 6 m * 2.5 m = 120 m3. So the capacity of the tank is 120 m3. So the answer is (c). The volume of the tank is 8m * 6m* 2.5m = 120m3. This is equal to 120000 litres. So the answer is (d) The volume of the tank is 8 m * 6 m * 2.5 m = 120 m3. One cu- bic meter contains 1000 litres, so the tank contains 120 m3 * 1000 liters/m3 = 120,000 liters. So the answer is (d). [StrategyQA] Yes or no: Can the Great Depression be treated with Prozac? The Great Depression was an economic depression. Prozac is a drug used to treat depression. Thus, the Great Depression could be treated with Prozac. So the an- swer is yes. Prozac is an anti-depressant medication. The Great Depres- sion is not a disease. Thus, Prozac cannot treat the Great Depression. So the answer is no. The Great Depression is a time pe- riod. Prozac is used to treat de- pression (the mental illness). Thus, the Great Depression can not be treated with Prozac. So the answer is no. [ARC-easy] Which source of energy is nonrenewable? (a) coal. (b) sunlight. (c) water. (d) wood. Coal, sunlight, and water are all renewable sources of energy. Wood is a nonrenewable source of energy. So the answer is (d). A nonrenewable source of en- ergy is one in which the source is not replenished in a short amount of time. Thus, the only option that is nonrenewable is coal. So the answer is (a). Coal is a fossil fuel and is formed from dead organisms from the past. Coal cannot be produced in a short period of time, so it is considered a nonrenewable source of energy. So the answer is (a). [ARC-challenge] Students studied the revolution of Earth around the Sun. During which month will Florida have the most sunlight energy avail- able? (a) March. (b) June. (c) September. (d) December. The Earth is closest to the Sun in December, hence Florida will have the most sunlight energy available in December. So the an- swer is (d). Earth is closest to the Sun on June 21, the summer solstice. So the answer is (b). Florida is closer to the sun during June, so it will have the most sun- light energy during that month. So the answer is (b). Table 13: Additional examples where self-consistency helps repair the errors over greedy decode on PaLM-540B. Two sampled reasoning paths that are consistent with the ground truth are shown. Table 14: Few-shot exemplars for AQUA-RAT. Q: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is? Answer Choices: (a) 50 (b) 45 (c) 65 (d) 78 (e) 64 A: If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. So the new mean would be 50. The answer is (a). Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a. Answer Choices: (a) 1/2 (b) 3/2 (c) 5/2 (d) 4/2 (e) 7/2 A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is (b). Q: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?
