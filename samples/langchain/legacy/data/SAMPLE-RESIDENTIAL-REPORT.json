PROJECT: 123 Main Street Section 1.0 \u2013 Executive Summary KAIZEN SAFETY SOLUTIONS, LLC was hired to investigate damage, quantify potential contamination and provide repair and remediation recommendations following the ABC fire and associated toxic smoke that occurred on or about November 25, 2020 and impacted the single family residence located at 123 Main Street. The homeowner reported that his family could not inhabit the residence due to the smoke like post-fire odor and adverse health effects he experienced after being in the residence for short periods of time. The ABC fire engulfed and destroyed over 6,000 building structures and thousands of personal and commercial vehicles. The toxic smoke generated by the burning contents of the thousands of residential/commercial structures and vehicles, permeated every remaining structure in its path. The toxic chemical and respirable particulate insults to the structures left standing is unprecedented from a health hazard evaluation perspective. Prior to KAIZEN SAFETY SOLUTIONS, LLC site visit, no repairs have been made to the residence. The homeowner boarded up the home to prevent unauthorized entry into the home. Windows on the east side of the home had been damaged or broken from the heat of the fire. Sample report This residence survived the fire storm even though, in every direction around this residence, all structures (residential homes, sheds and garages) were reduced to ashes with the exception of chimneys and the metal shells of a variety of personal vehicles left behind. The home owner reported that the remains of the residence to the west of his property was a home-based pesticide business. On June 29, 2020, Dawn Bolstad-Johnson, MPH, CIH, CSP of KAIZEN SAFETY SOLUTIONS, LLC conducted the site visit and performed the industrial hygiene evaluation and sampling. Real Time Direct Read instrumentation was utilized to scan the entire residence for airborne respirable sized particulate and airborne toxic chemicals that may contribute to the reported health effects. Tape lift samples of dust were collected from various locations and analyzed for soot using both visual and TEM analysis. Bulk samples of carpet dust were collected from each bedroom and a section of the filter from the HVAC unit was collected and analyzed for particle/fiber characterization. Bulk samples of drywall were collected and analyzed for asbestos. Mold sampling was conducted within the residence. Finally soil samples were collected and analyzed for potential contamination. At first glance, the obvious fire damage appeared to be limited to the east side of the residence where the entire side was scorched by fire and high heat. The sampling conducted in and around this residence was completed 8 months after the initial fire and toxic smoke insult.

It is important to note that average residences are not designed to be airtight. It is expected that concentrations of particulates and molds would be lower inside a residence when compared to outside air because of the installed HVAC system and the presence of filtered air. When the outside air consists of bellows of toxic smoke, any residence in its path is going to be adversely impacted as the toxic smoke will find its way through the cracks in construction, open/broken doors and windows and porous materials that are used to build the structure. Direct read airborne chemical results revealed that the highest concentration of airborne toxic chemicals was discovered in the main living area (living room) of the residence. The average phosphine levels in this residence are above the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ASTDR) Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG) of 0.5 ppm which is a recommended public health exposure for no longer than one hour. At least eighteen (18) sample locations were determined for toxic gases. The summary of all results is found in Section 7 of this report. The results show that there are a variety of airborne toxic chemicals in every living space within the house. Many of the airborne concentrations exceeded NIOSH and/or CAL-OSHA workplace standards. Based on the observations and analysis of the samples collected, it is recommended that this residence not be occupied in its current condition. Based on the sample data, every porous material, including building materials and contents, that is capable of absorbing toxic chemicals is presumed to be contaminated. Sample report Two (2) soil samples were collected. One was a composite sample consisting of soil collected from each side of the residence (north, west, south and east) and the second sample was collected from the entry to the crawl space under the residence. Levels of organochlorine pesticides were determined as well as soluble nitrates, chlorides and sulfates. The soil samples were used as a screening tool to determine potential levels of contamination. Additional soil samples are recommended to determine area of potential contamination as well as compliance with the California regulations on soil remediation limits in residential areas. The data for the soil samples is included in Tables 9A, 9B, 9C, and 9D The toxic load of the smoke as it moved through this residence is significant due to all of the contents of all of the homes and vehicles that burned prior to the smoke reaching this residence. The toxicity of the smoke generated from the ABC fire includes but is not limited to the toxic gases generated by the pyrolysis of the following: \u00a7 building materials of multiple residences, commercial buildings; \u00a7 vehicles, gasoline, metals, tires; \u00a7 recreational vehicles, trailers; \u00a7 household chemicals, household pesticides; \u00a7 household furniture; \u00a7 household electronics; DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A SAMPLE REPORT INTENDED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT POST FIRE SAMPLING ONLY.

The recommendation is that the home should either be properly remediated or it should be demolished and replaced. Based on the observed airborne toxic chemical concentrations still present eight months post fire, removing all contaminated materials and deconning the residence will be a challenge. In order to ensure complete remediation, it is recommended that all porous materials, textiles, carpets, clothing, books, furniture, walls, ceilings and insulation be removed and replaced; non- porous materials should be decontaminated. After all porous materials are removed and non- porous materials are decontaminated, it is recommended that the industrial hygiene sampling be repeated to ensure that the structural members of the home are not off-gassing what may have been absorbed by the smoke insult on the home. In addition, the soil surrounding the residence and under the crawl space would need to remediated to California Soil Remediation Limits for residential areas. A thorough cost benefit analysis is recommended to determine the efficacy of remediation and repair versus complete demolition and rebuild. Sample report Section 2.0 - Definitions 1.

Respirable size particulates are defined as particulates < 5.0 \u00b5m and inhalable sized particulates are 10 \u00b5m in size. Respirable sized particulates are small enough to deposit in the lower regions of the lungs. The Inhalable size particles usually get trapped in the upper respiratory system. The PTrak measures ultrafine particulates, defined to have a diameter of 0.1 \u00b5m. The ultrafine particulates can be inhaled and are small enough to also be present in the exhaled breath. Indoor particulate counts are compared to those observed outside. In theory, concentrations of indoor air particulates should be equal to or less than those observed outside because the indoor environment has filtered air. When indoor particulate levels are higher than those observed outside, it is can be related to an indoor source.

PROJECT: 123 Main Street Section 8.0 \u2013 Discussion of Results At first glance, the obvious fire damage appears to be limited to the northside of the residence where the entire side was scorched by fire and high heat. However, the highest concentration of airborne toxic chemicals were discovered in the main living area (living room) which is located in the center of residence away from the north wall. It is important to note that typical residences are not designed to be airtight. It is expected that concentrations of particulates and molds would be lower inside a residence when compared to outside air, because of the installed HVAC system and the presence of filtered air. Air flow within rooms and even within wall cavities can shift as the pressure differential shifts when a window is opened or a door is closed. The ABC fire engulfed and destroyed over 6,000 building structures and thousands of personal and commercial vehicles. The toxic smoke generated by the burning contents of the thousands of residential/commercial structures and vehicles, permeated every remaining structure in its path. The toxic chemical and respirable particulate insult to the structures left standing, is unprecedented from a health hazard evaluation perspective. Sample report The sampling conducted in this residence was completed over REDACTED after the initial fire and toxic smoke insult. Every porous material that is capable of absorbing toxic chemicals is presumed to be contaminated. The following paragraphs summarize findings with reference to each table of results. Tape Lift Samples Table 1 \u2013 High levels of soot were determined in the bedroom in several areas on the bunk beds. This is an indicator of fire contamination in the residence. Bulk Dust Characterization samples Table 2 - High levels of soot were determined in the carpet samples. Further analysis revealed high levels of chlorides and cyanide. These are common constituents of fire smoke. Asbestos Bulk Sampling Table 3 \u2013 Three (3) samples of drywall were collected from an inspection hole in the master bedroom. All samples tested negative for asbestos in all layers. Please note these samples do not satisfy the number of samples of unique homogeneous areas required for a full asbestos survey. This was a screen test only. DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A SAMPLE REPORT INTENDED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT POST FIRE SAMPLING ONLY.

PROJECT: 123 Main Street Real Time Particulate Samples Table 4 \u2013 Real time particulate sampling revealed elevated respirable sized particulate (0.3 um) in every room sampled compared to outside. When compared to outside air samples, the master bedroom, kid\u2019s bedroom and the hall closet reported elevated particulate counts on all six channels monitored. Mold/Fungal Spore sampling Table 5 \u2013 Higher than outside concentrations of penicillium/aspergillus spores were observed in the master bedroom and bathroom. Other Biologic Particulate sampling Table 6 \u2013 Higher than outside concentrations of cellulose fibers were observed in the kitchen, living room, bathroom, master bedroom and kid\u2019s bedroom. Higher than outside concentration of glass fibers was observed in the living room, master bedroom, bathroom and kid\u2019s bedroom. The elevated levels of epithelial (skin) cells is normal and expected. Photo Ionization Detector (PID) Table 7 \u2013 The results observed during the time each room in the residence was sampled were within normal range. There is nothing remarkable about this data. Sample report The PID unit scans for a wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOC). The equipment cannot positively identify the VOC, it can only report presence or absence of the range of VOCs that it can detect. This unit can detect VOCs that have an ionization potential of 10.6 eV or less. GASMET DX4040 Portable Ambient Air Analyzer The Gasmet DX4040 FTIR gas analyzer can detect up to 25 gases simultaneously. The channel for 1,3 butadiene was removed from the analysis as it had a significant amount of background noise and was identified as a false positive. This chemical was removed from the table of results. Eighteen (18) locations were sampled throughout the residence. Table 8 summarizes the data by providing average reading in the residence and the highest reading by location in the residence. Both NIOSH recommended workplace exposures limits and CAL OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits are provided for reference. The exceedances are highlighted in red and the cautions are highlighted in yellow. The areas highlighted in yellow did not exceed published 8- hour workplace exposure limits but would be undesirable for a 24 hour/7 day week residential exposure. Elevated concentrations of methylene chloride, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, hydrogen fluoride nitrogen dioxide and phosphine were found in various areas of the residence. Soil Sampling Two (2) soil samples were collected as a screening tool to determine if the soil surrounding the home and soil found in the crawl space could be potentially contaminated. One sample DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A SAMPLE REPORT INTENDED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT POST FIRE SAMPLING ONLY. Page 25"}, {"page_number": 26, "page_content": "PROJECT: 123 Main Street KAIZEN SAFETY SOLUTIONS, LLC. consisted of a composite sample from soil collected from all four sides of the residence. The second sample was collected from the entry area to the crawl space and consisted of soil found in the crawl space only. The soil was analyzed for Semi-Volatiles, PCBs, Pesticides, Anions (soluble) and RCRA 8 metals. Tables 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D and 9E summarize the soil samples. The soil samples tested negative for semi-volatiles, and PCBs. In addition, pesticides were determined in each of the samples and nitrates, chloride and sulfates were determined as well. California\u2019s regulations on Soil Remediation Limits are complex and associated with an overall Health Hazard Assessment. There are separate California regulations for pesticides. Please note the purpose of conducting the soil sampling was to use the results as a screening tool only. In order to determine a remediation scope of work for the soil, additional sampling may be needed.

PROJECT: 123 Main Street Section 9.0 \u2013 Recommendations Based on the observations and analysis of the samples collected, it is recommended that this residence not be occupied in its current condition. Based on the sample data, every porous material, including building materials and contents, that is capable of absorbing toxic chemicals is presumed to be contaminated. The results show that there are a variety of airborne toxic chemicals in every living space within the house. Many of the airborne concentrations exceeded NIOSH and/or CAL-OSHA workplace standards. The average phosphine levels in this residence are above the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ASTDR) Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG) of 0.5 ppm which is a recommended public health exposure for no longer than one hour. The real time sample results are limited to what the direct read instruments are able to detect. There are likely additional contaminants, not identified in this report, that were produced, carried by the smoke and fire and impacted this property that may also contribute to toxic contamination and potential adverse health effects. The tape lift samples show that there is fire contamination in the residence. Sample report The toxic load of the smoke, as it moved through this residence, is significant due to all of the contents of all of the homes and vehicles that burned prior to the smoke reaching this residence. The toxicity of the smoke generated from the ABC fire includes but is not limited to the toxic gases generated by the pyrolysis of the following: \u00a7 building materials of multiple residences, commercial buildings; \u00a7 vehicles, gasoline, metals, tires; \u00a7 recreational vehicles, trailers; \u00a7 household chemicals, household pesticides; \u00a7 household furniture; \u00a7 household electronics; \u00a7 plastic toys; \u00a7 carpeting, laminate flooring, etc. \u00a7 misc plastic load \u2013 appliances, food storage, furniture, shelving, printers, etc. The recommendation is that the home should either be properly remediated or it should be demolished and replaced. If it is determined that the home should be demolished, all applicable California and EPA regulations must be followed. Based on the observed airborne toxic chemical concentrations still present eight months post fire, removing all contaminated materials and deconning the residence will be a challenge. In order to ensure complete remediation, it is recommended that all porous materials: textiles, carpets, clothing, books, furniture, walls, ceilings and insulation be removed and replaced; non- DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A SAMPLE REPORT INTENDED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT POST FIRE SAMPLING ONLY.

After all porous materials are removed and non- porous materials are decontaminated, it is recommended that the industrial hygiene sampling be repeated to ensure that the structural members of the home are not off-gassing what may have been absorbed by the smoke insult on the home. A thorough cost benefit analysis is recommended to determine the efficacy of remediation and repair versus complete demolition and rebuild.
