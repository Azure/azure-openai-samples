# Building Solutions using Azure OpenAI Services
This repository provides a set of code samples of building intelligence solution using Azure OpenAI Service. We also provide some code samples how to create tools in order to take advantages of langchain's chain framework.

1. **Query Based Search with Azure Cognitive Search** - How to build a text similarity based solution with knowledge store like Azure Cognitive Search 
2. **Large Document Summerization** - Example of generate short summery for large doucment that cannot fit into one request.
3. **Question and answering (with source) using Redis Vector store** - Answering user question and provide the source of the answers using Redis
4. **Bing search with Azure OpenAI Service** - Example of using Azure Bing Search to extend Azure OpenAI Service to answer questions
5. **Answer questions using CSV file** - Use a CSV file as source of information and answer questions.
6. **Answer questions using Azure SQL or SQL Server** - Answering questions using data stored inside a SQL Server database
7. **Answer questions using Azure Cognitive Search** - Similar to 5 & 6, demonstrate how Azure OpenAI Service can create a plan to answer questions where information is stored in Azure Cognitive Search. This demo is different from other Azure Cognitive Search demo but we let Azure OpenAI decide how to engage Azure Cognitive Search store, what query should be used to get necessary information.
