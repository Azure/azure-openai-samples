## Example 1

<context>
There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face,
on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were
settled for ever.

## Example 2

<context>
Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment;
resident of London. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never
found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life.
He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of
one for twenty years.
