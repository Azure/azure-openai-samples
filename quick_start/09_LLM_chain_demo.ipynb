       "\"NHS finances are so dire that patients could soon be forced to pay to use basic services such as GPs, doctors leaders warned last night. Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges. All three major parties have denied there will be any end to the principle that the NHS should be free at the point of use. Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges . Critics will say that if GPs had not enjoyed such enormous pay rises over the past decade, there would be much more money around. In an interview with the Guardian, Dr Porter said of the parties fighting the election: ‘I think they will be tempted. They said in 1950 that a Labour government wouldn’t introduce charging and it did.’ The introduction of prescription charges prompted NHS founder Nye Bevan to resign from Clement Attlee’s government in April 1951. Dr Porter said it was ‘inescapable’ that the next government would consider introducing fees as a way of tackling the £30billion budget gap that NHS England has forecast will open by 2020 unless it achieves its target of £22billion in efficiency savings and receives £8billion of extra annual funding. He said: ‘Could a future government be tempted? Yes, they could, but they must resist that temptation.’ Critics will say that if GPs had not enjoyed such enormous pay rises over the past decade, there would be much more money around . The Tories have jumped to a six point lead over Labour in the polls, putting David Cameron within striking distance of an overhaul majority. With just over three weeks until polling day, 39 per cent of voters now say they will back the Conservatives compared to just 33 per cent for Labour, according to the pollsters ICM. The shock poll, published this afternoon, comes after the Tories unveiled their key election pledge to scrap inheritance tax on family homes worth up to £1million. Scroll down for video . With just over three weeks until polling day, 39 per cent of voters now say they will back the Conservatives compared to just 33 per cent for Labour, according to the pollsters ICM . Bad news: Just 33 per cent of voters plan on supporting Ed Miliband, pictured at the Labour Manifesto Launch, in the upcoming election . It came after a series of polls had suggested Labour had pulled slightly ahead of the Tories and will be a major blow to Ed Miliband in the wake of the his manifesto launch today. According to the ICM poll for the Guardian, the Tories have jumped three per cent in the last month – while Labour has dropped two points. The Lib Dems remain unchanged on 8 per cent – with Ukip even further behind on 7 per cent, tied in fourth place with the Greens. However, a separate poll by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft had to two parties tied on 33 per cent. Ukip and the Lib Dems are each up three points at 13 per cent and 9 per cent. But the Tory campaign will be buoyed by the Guardian ICM poll which gives the party its strongest public support since 2012 – and three points higher than it achieved in 2010. According to the ICM poll for the Guardian, the Tories have jumped three per cent in the last month – while Labour has dropped two points . David Cameron, buoyed by a new poll today, was out campaigning in Alnwick, Northumberland, today . Mr Cameron has consistently claimed the Tories can win a working majority at the election – having fallen just short five years ago. The Prime Minister needs another 23 seats to take the number of Tory MPs in the House of Commons to 326. Mr Cameron has pitched the election as a straight choice between himself and Mr Miliband and will be encourage by further findings buried in today's poll, showing that voters are increasingly happy with his performance as Prime Minister. Ed Miliband, unveiling Labour's manifesto in Manchester today, suffered a blow today after polls showed he was falling behind David Cameron in the race for Number 10 . The survey gives Mr Cameron a public satisfaction rating of plus 18 – with 52 per cent of voters saying he is doing a good job, and only 34 per cent suggesting he is doing badly. Only in November, Mr Cameron's net score was -3 last November. Mr Cameron's personal rating remains comfortably ahead of Ed Miliband's – with the Labour leader languishing on -30. Mr Cameron's standing is also streets ahead of that of all the other political leaders – with Nick Clegg stuck on -20 and Nigel Farage on –16. Mr Cameron and the Chancellor George Osborne are also the most 'trusted team to run the economy properly' for 44 per cent of voters. This is compared to just 17 per cent who would rather trust Mr Miliband and Ed Balls. Hungry for power: SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon last night admitted she understands concerns of English voters about her party being involved in a coalition government. The Scottish First Minister said: ‘I understand how people south of the border think, “Oh my goodness how will it work? It’s a mess”.’ She also suggested that David Cameron had been ‘not unhelpful’ to the SNP by gaining the party greater publicity. ‘At every Westminster election I’ve fought until this one, the biggest challenge that we’ve had to overcome is being heard and being relevant. We don’t have this problem this time,’ she told The Times. ‘The message it’s given to people in Scotland is – if this is the attention we get just from the SNP riding high in the polls, imagine how loud our voice would be if that was translated into seats. So in that respect I absolutely think it is not unhelpful.’ Miss Sturgeon’s remarks came after she had insisted that she would put Ed Miliband into Downing Street even if Labour wins 40 fewer seats than the Tories in a hung Parliament. Polls suggest the SNP is on the brink of a landslide on a scale unprecedented in modern British politics, winning as many as 50 of Scotland’s 59 Commons seats. That would be all but certain to leave it holding the balance of power at Westminster for the first time. In an interview with BBC Newsnight, Miss Sturgeon insisted: ‘Even if the Tories are the largest party, if there is an anti-Tory majority, my offer to Labour is to work together to keep the Tories out.’ Asked whether Mr Cameron’s party being ahead of Labour by ‘ten, 20, 30, 40’ seats would have an impact on her decision, she said: ‘Governments in the House of Commons are about who can command a majority. 'If there is an anti-Tory majority, yes... we would work with Labour to stop the Tories getting into Downing Street.’ Pledge: Miss Sturgeon’s remarks came after she had insisted that she would put Ed Miliband (right) into Downing Street even if Labour wins 40 fewer seats than the Tories in a hung Parliament. Left, David Cameron . Labour has ruled out a coalition with the SNP but on more than 100 occasions in recent weeks senior figures have refused to rule out a less formal arrangement. Most likely are vote-by-vote negotiations which would see the SNP agree to support a minority Labour government in key Parliamentary votes, after seeking to extract concessions for Scotland. The Prime Minister called Miss Sturgeon’s threat to prop up a weak Labour government ‘frightening’ and said it would lead to ‘economic ruin’. Nick Clegg said last night he would not support any deal with Labour that relies on it being propped up by the SNP. The Liberal Democrat leader said his first talks would be with the party with most seats – which most polls indicate will be the Tories.\""
