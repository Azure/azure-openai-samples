# GPT Fundamentals, Use Cases and Sample Solutions
This repository contains resources to help you understand how to use GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) offered by Azure OpenAI at the fundamental level, explore sample end-to-end solutions, and learn about various use cases. 

## What is GPT?
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a Large Language Model (LLM) developed by OpenAI. It is a deep learning model based on the Transformer architecture. For more information, refer to [OpenAI](openai.com).

## Resources
The following resources are available in this repository:

- [Quick Start](./quick_start/): A collection of notebooks where you can quickly start with using GPT. 

- [Use Cases](./use_cases/): A collection of notebooks illustrating examples on how to use GPT in various applications, such as chatbots, customer service, and content generation etc.

- [Langchain, Semantic Kernel and Prompt Flow Samples](./samples/)
- [Serverless SQL GPT](https://github.com/balakreshnan/Samples2023/blob/main/AzureML/serverlesssqlgpt.md) - Natural language processing (NLP) with GPT in Azure Synapse Analytics Serverless SQL using Azure Machine Learning.

## GPT Version
As of now, the samples here are based on GPT 3.5. We will update accordingly when the GPT-4 is widely accessible.

## Set Up
To use sample codes in this repo, we suggest you setup .env file where you store key informations for Azure services. See [.env.sample](./.env.sample) file for example.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this repository. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

As technologies changes very fast, we endevour to keep this repository updated as quick as possible. However, this is heavily rely on keen community contributors to make this happen.
