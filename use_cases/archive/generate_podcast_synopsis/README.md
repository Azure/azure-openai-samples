This repo illustrates how to use OpenAI GPT to 
- generate a synopsis from a podcast transcription into multiple languages.
- generate 2-3 tag lines based on the podcast content.
- generate serch engine optimised (SEO) keywords.

# Dataset
This example uses the [transcription](https://www.ft.com/content/935ee7eb-e11d-4458-94f6-25e1d0ccd9a2) of [podcast : Why SVBâ€™s collapse is not a 2008 repeat](https://www.ft.com/content/c6fb49cb-20fc-4b8d-b693-9eff09f41580) avaiable from [Financial Times](ft.com) to illustrate how to make use of OpenAI GPT for the use case described above.
