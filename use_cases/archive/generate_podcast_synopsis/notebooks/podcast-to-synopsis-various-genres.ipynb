      "Robert Armstrong, the FT's US financial commentator, discusses the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and why it is not a repeat of 2008. He explains that two factors led to SVB's downfall: bad decisions at the bank and a rapid increase in interest rates. Rob also examines how SVB was affected by these changes, as well as the implications for other banks in terms of regulation and solvency. Finally, he emphasizes that people should not panic about their deposits being safe if they are under $250,000. Robert Armstrong, an expert on banking regulation, discusses the implications of recent financial issues for banks. He explains that both top-tier and second-tier banks now have more capital than before 2008 and suggests that regulators need to think harder about the threat posed by securities building up on bank balance sheets. He also speaks about maturity transformation as a form of 'black magic' and cautions businesspeople against depositing money in a bank simply because their rich friend did so. Lastly, he expresses his thoughts on how the structure of the industry may change in coming years due to increased rate risk and asset liability matching crisis.\n"

In this episode, Robert Armstrong from the Financial Times talks about the two-tier system of banking regulation and how it affects banks' balance sheets.
