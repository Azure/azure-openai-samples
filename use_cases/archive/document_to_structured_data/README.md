# Use Case : Extract key sections from document
This repo illustrates how to use OpenAI GPT to convert unstructured data into structured data. This is demonstrated by:
- extracting key sections from a resume, and output results to `json` format.

# Dataset
This example uses a sample resume downloaded as it is from linkedin.

# Notebooks
- [document-to-structured-data.ipynb](./notebooks/document-to-structured-data.ipynb) consist of sample codes on extracting key sections from a resume and output to `json` format. 

# Future Work
- extracting key information from other type of documents, into structure data.
